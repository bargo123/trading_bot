Additional Praise for Inside the Black Box
“Rishi presents a thorough overview of quant trading in an easy-to-read 
format, free of much of the hype and hysteria that has recently surrounded 
computerized trading. The book clearly categorizes the different types of 
strategies, explaining in plain English the basic ideas behind how and when 
they work. Most importantly, it dispels the popular notion that all quants 
are the same, exposing the diversity of the types of skills and thinking that 
are involved in quant trading and related disciplines. An excellent read for 
anyone who wants to understand what the field is all about.”
—Shakil Ahmed, PhD, Global Head of Market Making, Citi Equities
“To look at the man, you would never know that Rishi could write so clear-
ly and effectively about something as complex as quantitative trading and 
investment. But he does and does it brilliantly. And, even if you already own 
the first edition, you should buy this one, too. The new material on high 
speed trading is worth the price of admission, and you will have a chance, 
especially in Chapter 16, to see Rishi at his incisive and high spirited best. If 
you don’t laugh out loud, you have no soul.”
—Galen Burghardt, Director of Research, Newedge
“Quant managers will find their meetings with investors to be smoother if 
the investors have read this book.  And even more so if the manager him or 
herself has read and understood it.”
—David DeMers, Portfolio Manager, SAC Capital Advisors, LP
“In this second edition of Inside the Black Box Rishi highlights role of quant 
trading in recent financial crises with clear language and without using any 
complex equations. In chapter 11 he addresses common quant myths. He 
leads us effortlessly through the quant trading processes and makes it very 
easy to comprehend, as he himself is a quant trader.”
—Pankaj N. Patel, Global Head of Quantitative Equity Research,  
Credit Suisse

History is a relentless master. It has no present, only the past 
rushing into the future. To try to hold fast is to be swept aside.
—John F. Kennedy
W
ithin the investment management business, a wildly misunderstood 
niche is booming, surely but in relative obscurity. This niche is popu-
lated by some of the brightest people ever to work in the field, and they are 
working to tackle some of the most interesting and challenging problems in 
modern finance. This niche is known by several names: quantitative trading, 
systematic trading, or black box trading. As in almost every field, technol-
ogy is revolutionizing the way things are being done, and very rarely, also 
what is being done. And, as is true of revolutions generally (in particular, 
scientific ones), not everyone understands or likes what’s happening.
I mentioned above that this is a technological revolution, which may 
have struck you as being strange, considering we’re talking about quant 
trading here. But the reality is that the difference between quant traders and 
discretionary ones is precisely a technological one. Make no mistake: Being 
good at investing almost always involves some math, whether it’s a funda-
mental analyst building a model of a company’s revenues, costs, and result-
ing profits or losses, or computing a price‐to‐earnings ratio. Graham and 
Dodd’s Security Analysis has a whole chapter regarding financial statement 
analysis, and that bible of fundamental value investing has more formulae 
in it than this book.
Just as in any other application where doing things in a disciplined, 
repeatable, consistent way is useful—whether it’s in building cars or flying 
airplanes—investing can be systematized. It should be systematized. And 
quant traders have gone some distance down the road of systematizing it. 
Car building is still car building, whether it’s human hands turning ratchets 
or machines doing it. Flying a plane is not viewed differently when a human 
pilot does the work than when an autopilot does the work. In other words, 
the same work is being done, it’s just being done in a different way. This is a 
technological difference, at its heart.
Preface to the Second Edition

## Page 16

xiv  Preface to the Second e dition
If I say, “I’d like to own cheap stocks,” I could, theoretically,  hand‐
compute every company’s price‐to‐earnings ratio, manually search for the 
cheapest ones, and manually go to the marketplace to buy them. Or I could 
write a computer program that scans a database that has all of those price‐
to‐earnings ratios loaded into it, finds all the ones that I defined up‐front as 
being cheap, and then goes out and buys those stocks at the market using 
trading algorithms. The how part of the work is quite different in one case 
from the other. But the stocks I own at the end of it are identical, and for 
identical reasons.
So, if what we’re talking about here is a completely rational evolution 
in how we’re doing a specific kind of work, and if we’re not being unreason-
ably technophobic, then why is it that reporters, politicians, the general pub-
lic, and even many industry professionals really dislike quant trading? There 
are two reasons. One is that, in some cases, the dislike comes from people 
whose jobs are being replaced by technology. For example, it is very obvious 
that many of the most active opponents of high‐frequency trading are pri-
marily fighting not out of some altruistic commitment to the purest embodi-
ment of a capitalist marketplace (though that would be so terrifically ironic 
that I’d love if it were true), but because their livelihood is threatened by a 
superior way of doing things. This is understandable, and fair enough. But 
it’s not good for the marketplace if those voices win out, because ultimately 
they are advocating stagnancy. There’s a reason that the word 
 
Luddite has 
a negative connotation.
A second reason, far more common in my experience, is that people 
don’t understand quant trading, and what we don’t understand, we tend 
to fear and dislike. This book is aimed at improving the understanding of 
quant trading of various types of participants in the investment manage-
ment industry. Quants are themselves often guilty of exacerbating the prob-
lem by being unnecessarily cagey about even the broadest descriptions of 
their activities. This only breeds mistrust in the general community, and it 
turns out not to be necessary in the least.
This book takes you on a tour through the black box, inside and out. 
It sheds light on the work that quants do, lifting the veil of mystery that 
surrounds quantitative trading, and allowing those interested in doing so to 
evaluate quants and their strategies.
The first thing that should be made clear is that people, not machines, 
are responsible for most of the interesting aspects of quantitative trading. 
Quantitative trading can be defined as the systematic implementation of 
trading strategies that human beings create through rigorous research. In 
this context, systematic is defined as a disciplined, methodical, and auto-
mated approach. Despite this talk of automation and systematization, peo-
ple conduct the research and decide what the strategies will be, people select 

## Page 17

Preface to the Second Edition  xv
the universe of securities for the system to trade, and people choose what 
data to procure and how to clean those data for use in a systematic context, 
among a great many other things. These people, the ones behind quant trad-
ing strategies, are commonly referred to as quants or quant traders.
Quants employ the scientific method in their research. Though this re-
search is aided by technology and involves mathematics and formulae, the 
research process is thoroughly dependent on human decision making. In 
fact, human decisions pervade nearly every aspect of the design, implemen-
tation, and monitoring of quant trading strategies. As I’ve indicated already, 
quant strategies and traditional discretionary investment strategies, which 
rely on human decision makers to manage portfolios day to day, are rather 
similar in what they do.
The differences between a quant strategy and a discretionary strategy 
can be seen in how the strategy is created and in how it is implemented. By 
carefully researching their strategies, quants are able to assess their ideas 
in the same way that scientists test theories. Furthermore, by utilizing a 
computerized, systematic implementation, quants eliminate the arbitrari -
ness that pervades so many discretionary trading strategies. In essence, 
decisions driven by emotion, indiscipline, passion, greed, and fear—what 
many consider the key pratfalls of playing the market—are eliminated 
from the quant’s investment process. They are replaced by an analytical 
and systematic approach that borrows from the lessons learned in so many 
other fields: If something needs to be done repeatedly and with a great deal 
of discipline, computers will virtually always outshine humans. We simply 
aren’t cut out for repetition in the way that computers are, and there’s 
nothing wrong with that. Computers, after all, aren’t cut out for creativity 
the way we are; without humans telling computers what to do, comput -
ers wouldn’t do much of anything. The differences in how a strategy is 
designed and implemented play a large part in the consistent, favorable 
risk/reward profile a well‐run quant strategy enjoys relative to most dis -
cretionary strategies.
To clarify the scope of this book, it is important to note that I focus on 
alpha‐oriented strategies and largely ignore quantitative index traders or 
other implementations of beta strategies. Alpha strategies attempt to gener-
ate returns by skillfully timing the selection and/or sizing of various portfo-
lio holdings; beta strategies mimic or slightly improve on the performance 
of an index, such as the S&P 500. Though quantitative index fund manage-
ment is a large industry, it requires little explanation. Neither do I spend 
much time on the field of financial engineering, which typically plays a role 
in creating or managing new financial products such as collateralized debt 
obligations (CDOs). Nor do I address quantitative analysis, which typically 
supports discretionary investment decisions. Both of these are interesting

subjects, but they are so different from quant trading as to be deserving of 
their own, separate discussions carried out by experts in those fields.
This book is divided into four parts. Part One (Chapters 1 and 2) pro-
vides a general but useful background on quantitative trading. Part Two 
(Chapters 3 through 9) details the contents of the black box. Part Three 
(Chapters 10 through 12) is an introduction to high‐frequency trading, the 
infrastructure that supports such high‐speed trading, and some truths and 
myths regarding this controversial activity. Part Four (Chapters 13 through 
16) provides an analysis of quant trading and techniques that may be use-
ful in assessing quant traders and their strategies. Finally, Chapter 17 looks 
at the present and future of quant trading and its place in the investment 
world.
It is my aspiration to explain quant trading in an intuitive manner. I 
describe what quants do and how they do it by drawing on the economic 
rationale for their strategies and the theoretical basis for their techniques. 
Equations are avoided, and the use of jargon is limited and explained, when 
required at all. My aim is to demonstrate that what many call a black box 
is in fact transparent, intuitively sensible, and readily understandable. I also 
explore the lessons that can be learned from quant trading about investing 
in general and how to evaluate quant trading strategies and their practition-
ers. As a result, Inside the Black Box may be useful for a variety of partici-
pants in and commentators on the capital markets. For portfolio managers, 
analysts, and traders, whether quantitative or discretionary, this book will 
help contextualize what quants do, how they do it, and why. For investors, 
the financial media, regulators, or anyone with a reasonable knowledge of 
capital markets in general, this book will engender a deeper understanding 
of this niche.

Acknowledgments
I 
am indebted to Manoj Narang, my brother, for his help with Part IV of 
this book, and to Mani Mahjouri for all of his suggestions and help. Mike 
Beller’s and Dmitry Sarkisov’s help with the micro‐bursting information 
was both enlightening and very much appreciated. My colleagues at T2AM, 
Myong Han, Yimin Guo, Huang Pan, and Julie Wilson, read through vari-
ous portions of this text and offered many valuable suggestions. This book 
would not be readable without the untiring editing of Arzhang Kamarei, 
who edited the first edition.
I must acknowledge the help of the rest of my partners at T2AM: Eric 
Cressman, John Cutsinger, and Elizabeth Castro.
For their help getting some metrics on the quant trading universe, I’d 
like to thank Chris Kennedy and Ryan Duncan of Newedge, Sang Lee of the 
Aite Group, and the Barclay Group. Underlying data, where necessary, were 
downloaded from Yahoo! Finance or Bloomberg, unless otherwise noted.
Since ItBB came out in 2009, I have been grateful for the support 
sh
 
own to me and the book by Newedge (especially Keith Johnson, Leslie 
 
Richman, Brian Walls, Galen Burghardt, and Isabelle Lixi), Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch (especially Michael Lynch, Lisa Conde, Tim Cox, and Omer 
 
Corluhan), Morgan Stanley (especially Michael Meade), and the CME 
Group (especially Kelly Brown).
For the second edition, I thank Philip Palmedo, Brent Boyer, Aaron 
Brown, and Werner Krebs for their constructive criticisms, which resulted 
in various improvements. Thanks also to Pankaj Patel, Dave DeMers, John 
Burnell, John Fidler, and Camille Hayek for their help with various bits of 
new content.

Look into their minds, at what wise men do and don’t.
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
J
ohn is a quant trader running a midsized hedge fund. He completed an 
undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science at a top 
school in the early 1990s. John immediately started working on Wall Street 
trading desks, eager to capitalize on his quantitative background. After 
seven years on the Street in various quant‐oriented roles, John decided to 
start his own hedge fund. With partners handling business and operations, 
John was able to create a quant strategy that recently was trading over 
$1.5 billion per day in equity volume. More relevant to his investors, the 
strategy made money on 60 percent of days and 85 percent of months—a 
rather impressive accomplishment.
Despite trading billions of dollars of stock every day, there is no shout-
ing at John’s hedge fund, no orders being given over the phone, and no 
drama in the air; in fact, the only sign that there is any trading going on 
at all is the large flat‐screen television in John’s office that shows the strat -
egy’s performance throughout the day and its trading volume. John can’t 
give you a fantastically interesting story about why his strategy is long this 
stock or short that one. While he is monitoring his universe of thousands 
of stocks for events that might require intervention, for the most part he 
lets the automated trading strategy do the hard work. What John moni -
tors quite carefully, however , is the health of his strategy and the market 
environment’s impact on it. He is aggressive about conducting research 
on an ongoing basis to adjust his models for changes in the market that 
would impact him.

4  The Quan T  u niverse
Across from John sits Mark, a recently hired partner of the fund who 
is researching high‐frequency trading. Unlike the firm’s first strategy, which 
only makes money on 6 out of 10 days, the high‐frequency efforts Mark 
and John are working on target a much more ambitious task: looking for 
smaller opportunities that can make money every day. Mark’s first attempt 
at high‐frequency strategies already makes money nearly 95 percent of the 
time. In fact, their target for this high‐frequency business is even loftier: 
They want to replicate the success of those firms whose trading strategies 
make money every hour , maybe even every minute, of every day. Such high‐
frequency strategies can’t accommodate large investments, because the op-
portunities they find are small, fleeting. The technology required to sup-
port such an endeavor is also incredibly expensive, not just to build, but to 
maintain. Nonetheless, they are highly attractive for whatever capital they 
can accommodate. Within their high‐frequency trading business, John and 
Mark expect their strategy to generate returns of about 200 percent a year , 
possibly much more.
There are many relatively small quant trading boutiques that go about 
their business quietly, as John and Mark’s firm does, but that have demon-
strated top‐notch results over reasonably long periods. For example, Quan-
titative Investment Management of Charlottesville, Virginia, averaged over 
20 percent per year for the 2002–2008 period—a track record that many 
discretionary managers would envy.
1
On the opposite end of the spectrum from these small quant shops 
are the giants of quant investing, with which many investors are already 
quite familiar . Of the many impressive and successful quantitative firms 
in this category, the one widely regarded as the best is Renaissance Tech-
nologies. Renaissance, the most famous of all quant funds, is famed for its  
35 percent average yearly returns (after exceptionally high fees), with ex-
tremely low risk, since 1990. In 2008, a year in which many hedge funds 
struggled mightily, Renaissance’s flagship Medallion Fund gained approxi-
mately 80 percent.
2 I am personally familiar with the fund’s track record, 
and it’s actually gotten better as time has passed—despite the increased 
competition and potential for models to stop working.
Not all quants are successful, however . It seems that once every decade 
or so, quant traders cause—or at least are perceived to cause—markets to 
move dramatically because of their failures. The most famous case by far 
is, of course, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), which nearly (but 
for the intervention of Federal Reserve banking officials and a consortium 
of Wall Street banks) brought the financial world to its knees. Although the 
world markets survived, LTCM itself was not as lucky. The firm, which aver-
aged 30 percent returns after fees for four years, lost nearly 100 percent of 
its capital in the debacle of August–October 1998 and left many investors

both skeptical and afraid of quant traders. Never mind that it is debatable 
whether this was a quant trading failure or a failure of human judgment 
in risk management, nor that it’s questionable whether LTCM was even a 
quant trading firm at all. It was staffed by PhDs and Nobel Prize–winning 
economists, and that was enough to cast it as a quant trading outfit, and to 
make all quants guilty by association.
Not only have quants been widely panned because of LTCM, but they 
have also been blamed (probably unfairly) for the crash of 1987 and (quite 
fairly) for the eponymous quant liquidation of 2007, the latter having se-
verely impacted many quant shops. Even some of the largest names in quant 
trading suffered through the quant liquidation of August 2007. For instance, 
Goldman Sachs’ largely quantitative Global Alpha Fund was down an es-
timated 40 percent in 2007 after posting a 6 percent loss in 2006.
3 In less 
than a week during August 2007, many quant traders lost between 10 and 
40 percent in a few days, though some of them rebounded strongly for the 
remainder of the month.
In a recent best‐selling nonfiction book, a former Wall Street Journal 
reporter even attempted to blame quant trading for the massive financial 
crisis that came to a head in 2008. There were gaps in his logic large enough 
to drive an 18‐wheeler through, but the popular perception of quants has 
never been positive. And this is all before high‐frequency trading (HFT) 
came into the public consciousness in 2010, after the Flash Crash on May 
10 of that year . Ever since then, various corners of the investment and trad-
ing world have tried very hard to assert that quants (this time, in the form 
of HFTs) are responsible for increased market volatility, instability in the 
capital markets, market manipulation, front‐running, and many other evils. 
We will look into HFT and the claims leveled against it in greater detail in 
Chapter 16, but any quick search of the Internet will confirm that quant 
trading and HFT have left the near‐total obscurity they enjoyed for decades 
and entered the mainstream’s thoughts on a regular basis.
Leaving aside the spectacular successes and failures of quant trading, and 
all of the ills for which quant trading is blamed by some, there is no doubt 
that quants cast an enormous shadow on the capital markets virtually every 
trading day . Across U.S. equity markets, a significant, and rapidly growing, 
proportion of all trading is done through algorithmic execution, one footprint 
of quant strategies. (Algorithmic execution is the use of computer software 
to manage and work an investor’s buy and sell orders in electronic markets.) 
Although this automated execution technology is not the exclusive domain 
of quant strategies—any trade that needs to be done, whether by an index 
fund or a discretionary macro trader , can be worked using execution algo-
rithms—certainly a substantial portion of all algorithmic trades are done by 
quants. Furthermore, quants were both the inventors and primary innovators 

## Page 26

of algorithmic trading engines. A mere five such quant traders account for 
about 1 billion shares of volume per day , in aggregate, in the United States 
alone. It is worth noting that not one of these is well known to the broader 
investing public, even now , after all the press surrounding high-frequency 
trading. The TABB Group, a research and advisory firm focused exclusively 
on the capital markets, estimates that, in 2008, approximately 58 percent 
of all buy‐side orders were algorithmically traded. TABB also estimates that 
this figure has grown some 37 percent per year , compounded, since 2005. 
More directly , the Aite Group published a study in early 2009 indicating that 
more than 60 percent of all U.S. equity transactions are attributable to short‐
term quant traders.
4 These statistics hold true in non‐U.S. markets as well. 
Black‐box trading accounted for 45 percent of the volume on the European 
Xetra electronic order‐matching system in the first quarter of 2008, which is 
36 percent more than it represented a year earlier .5
The large presence of quants is not limited to equities. In futures and 
foreign exchange markets, the domain of commodity trading advisors 
(CTAs), quants pervade the marketplace. Newedge Alternative Investment 
Solutions and Barclay Hedge used a combined database to estimate that 
almost 90 percent of the assets under management among all CTAs are 
managed by systematic trading firms as of August 2012. Although a great 
many of the largest and most established CTAs (and hedge funds generally) 
do not report their assets under management or performance statistics to 
any database, a substantial portion of these firms are actually quants also, 
and it is likely that the real figure is still over 75 percent. As of August 2012, 
Newedge estimates that the amount of quantitative futures money under 
management was $282.3 billion.
It is clear that the magnitude of quant trading among hedge funds is 
substantial. Hedge funds are private investment pools that are accessible 
only to sophisticated, wealthy individual or institutional clients. They can 
pursue virtually any investment mandate one can dream up, and they are 
allowed to keep a portion of the profits they generate for their clients. But 
this is only one of several arenas in which quant trading is widespread. Pro-
prietary trading desks at the various banks, boutique proprietary trading 
firms, and various multistrategy hedge fund managers who utilize quantita-
tive trading for a portion of their overall business each contribute to a much 
larger estimate of the size of the quant trading universe.
With such size and extremes of success and failure, it is not surprising 
that quants take their share of headlines in the financial press. And though 
most press coverage of quants seems to be markedly negative, this is not 
always the case. In fact, not only have many quant funds been praised for 
their steady returns (a hallmark of their disciplined implementation proc-
ess), but some experts have even argued that the existence of successful 

## Page 27

Why Does Quant Trading Matter?  7
quant strategies improves the marketplace for all investors, regardless of 
their style. For instance, Reto Francioni (chief executive of Deutsche Boerse 
AG, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) said in a speech that algo-
rithmic trading “benefits all market participants through positive effects on 
liquidity. ” Francioni went on to reference a recent academic study show-
ing “a positive causal relationship between algo trading and liquidity. ”
6 In-
deed, this is almost guaranteed to be true. Quant traders, using execution 
algorithms (hence, algo trading), typically slice their orders into many small 
pieces to improve both the cost and efficiency of the execution process. As 
mentioned before, although originally developed by quant funds, these algo-
rithms have been adopted by the broader investment community. By placing 
many small orders, other investors who might have different views or needs 
can also get their own executions improved.
Quants typically make markets more efficient for other participants by 
providing liquidity when other traders’ needs cause a temporary imbalance 
in the supply and demand for a security. These imbalances are known as 
inefficiencies, after the economic concept of efficient markets. True ineffi-
ciencies (such as an index’s price being different from the weighted basket 
of the constituents of the same index) represent rare, fleeting opportunities 
for riskless profit. But riskless profit, or arbitrage, is not the only—or even 
primary—way in which quants improve efficiency. The main inefficiencies 
quants eliminate (and, thereby, profit from) are not absolute and unassail-
able, but rather are probabilistic and require risk taking.
A classic example of this is a strategy called statistical arbitrage, and 
a classic statistical arbitrage example is a pairs trade. Imagine two stocks 
with similar market capitalizations from the same industry and with similar 
business models and financial status. For whatever reason, Company A is 
included in a major market index, an index that many large index funds 
are tracking. Meanwhile, Company B is not included in any major index. 
It is likely that Company A ’s stock will subsequently outperform shares of 
Company B simply due to a greater demand for the shares of Company A 
from index funds, which are compelled to buy this new constituent in or -
der to track the index. This outperformance will in turn cause a higher P/E 
multiple on Company A than on Company B, which is a subtle kind of inef-
ficiency. After all, nothing in the fundamentals has changed—only the na-
ture of supply and demand for the common shares. Statistical arbitrageurs 
may step in to sell shares of Company A to those who wish to buy, and buy 
shares of Company B from those looking to sell, thereby preventing the di-
vergence between these two fundamentally similar companies from getting 
out of hand and improving efficiency in market pricing. Let us not be naïve: 
They improve efficiency not out of altruism, but because these strategies are 
set up to profit if indeed a convergence occurs between Companies A and B.

8  The Quan T  u niverse
This is not to say that quants are the only players who attempt to profit 
by removing market inefficiencies. Indeed, it is likely that any alpha‐oriented 
trader is seeking similar sorts of dislocations as sources of profit. And, of 
course, there are times, such as August 2007, when quants actually cause the 
markets to be temporarily less efficient. Nonetheless, especially in smaller , 
less liquid, and more neglected stocks, statistical arbitrage players are often 
major providers of market liquidity and help establish efficient price discov-
ery for all market participants.
So, what can we learn from a quant’s approach to markets? The three 
answers that follow represent important lessons that quants can teach 
us—lessons that can be applied by any investment manager .
t he Benefit O f Dee P  t h OU ght
According to James Simons, the founder of the legendary Renaissance Tech-
nologies, one of the greatest advantages quants bring to the investment 
process is their systematic approach to problem solving. As Dr . Simons puts 
it, “The advantage scientists bring into the game is less their mathematical 
or computational skills than their ability to think scientifically. ”
7
The first reason it is useful to study quants is that they are forced 
to think deeply about many aspects of their strategy that are taken for 
granted by nonquant investors. Why does this happen? Computers are 
obviously powerful tools, but without absolutely precise instruction, they 
can achieve nothing. So, to make a computer implement a black‐box trad -
ing strategy requires an enormous amount of effort on the part of the 
developer . You can’t tell a computer to “find cheap stocks. ” You have to 
specify what find means, what cheap means, and what stocks are. For ex -
ample, finding might involve searching a database with information about 
stocks and then ranking the stocks within a market sector (based on some 
classification of stocks into sectors). Cheap might mean P/E ratios, though 
one must specify both the metric of cheapness and what level will be con -
sidered cheap. As such, the quant can build his system so that cheapness 
is indicated by a 10 P/E or by those P/Es that rank in the bottom decile of 
those in their sector . And stocks, the universe of the model, might be all 
U.S. stocks, all global stocks, all large cap stocks in Europe, or whatever 
other group the quant wants to trade.
All this defining leads to a lot of deep thought about exactly what one’s 
strategy is, how to implement it, and so on. In the preceding example, the 
quant doesn’t have to choose to rank stocks within their sectors. Instead, 
stocks can be compared to their industry peers, to the market overall, or to 
any other reasonable group. But the point is that the quant is encouraged to 

## Page 29

Why Does Quant Trading Matter?  9
be intentional about these decisions by virtue of the fact that the computer 
will not fill in any of these blanks on its own.
The benefit of this should be self‐evident. Deep thought about a strat-
egy is usually a good thing. Even better , this kind of detailed and rigorous 
working out of how to divide and conquer the problem of conceptualizing, 
defining, and implementing an investment strategy is useful to quants and 
discretionary traders alike. These benefits largely accrue from thorough-
ness, which is generally held to be a key ingredient to investment or trading 
success. By contrast, many (though certainly not all) discretionary traders, 
because they are not forced to be so precise in the specification of their 
strategy and its implementation, seem to take a great many decisions in an 
ad hoc manner . I have been in countless meetings with discretionary traders 
who, when I asked them how they decided on the sizes of their positions, 
responded with variations on the theme of “Whatever seemed reasonable. ” 
This is by no means a damnation of discretionary investment styles. I merely 
point out that precision and deep thought about many details, in addition to 
the bigger‐picture aspects of a strategy, can be a good thing, and this lesson 
can be learned from quants.
t he Meas U re M ent an D  Mis M eas U re M ent O f r isk
As mentioned earlier in this chapter , the history of L TCM is a lesson in the 
dangers of mismeasuring risk. Quants are naturally predisposed toward con-
ducting all sorts of measurements, including of risk exposure. This activity 
itself has potential benefits and downsides. On the plus side, there is a certain 
intentionality of risk taking that a well‐conceived quant strategy encourag -
es. Rather than accepting accidental risks, the disciplined quant attempts to 
isolate exactly what his edge is and focus his risk taking on those areas that 
isolate this edge. T o root out these risks, the quant must first have an idea 
of what these risks are and how to measure them. For example, most quant 
equity traders, recognizing that they do not have sufficient capabilities in fore-
casting the direction of the market itself, measure their exposure to the mar-
ket (using their net dollar or beta exposure, commonly) and actively seek to 
limit this exposure to a trivially small level by balancing their long portfolios 
against their short portfolios. On the other hand, there are very valid concerns 
about false precision, measurement error , and incorrect sets of assumptions 
that can plague attempts to measure risk and manage it quantitatively .
All the blowups we have mentioned, and most of those we haven’t, stem 
in one way or another from this overreliance on flawed risk measurement 
techniques. In the case of L TCM, for example, historical data showed that 
certain scenarios were likely , others unlikely , and still others had simply never

occurred. At that time, most market participants did not expect that a country 
of Russia’s importance, with a substantial supply of nuclear weapons and ma-
terials, would go bankrupt. Nothing like this had ever happened before. Nev-
ertheless, Russia indeed defaulted on its debt in the summer of 1998, sending 
the world’s markets into a frenzy and rendering useless any measurement of 
risk. The naïve overreliance on quantitative measures of risk, in this case, led 
to the near‐collapse of the financial markets in the autumn of 1998. But for 
a rescue orchestrated by the U.S. government and agreed on by most of the 
powerhouse banks on W all Street, we would have seen a very different path 
unfold for the capital markets and all aspects of financial life.
Indeed, the credit debacle that began to overwhelm markets in 2007 
and 2008, too, was likely avoidable. Banks relied on credit risk models 
that simply were unable to capture the risks correctly. In many cases, they 
seem to have done so knowingly, because it enabled them to pursue out-
sized short‐term profits (and, of course, bonuses for themselves). It should 
be said that most of these mismeasurements could have been avoided, or 
at least the resulting problems mitigated, by the application of better judg-
ment on the part of the practitioners who relied on them. Just as one cannot 
justifiably blame weather‐forecasting models for the way that New Orleans 
was impacted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, it would not make sense to 
blame quantitative risk models for the failures of those who created and use 
them. Traders can benefit from engaging in the exercise of understanding 
and measuring risk, so long as they are not seduced into taking ill‐advised 
actions as a result.
Dis C i P line D  iMP le M entati O n
Perhaps the most obvious lesson we can learn from quants comes from the 
discipline inherent to their approach. Upon designing and rigorously test-
ing a strategy that makes economic sense and seems to work, a properly 
run quant shop simply tends to let the models run without unnecessary, 
arbitrary interference. In many areas of life, from sports to science, the hu-
man ability to extrapolate, infer , assume, create, and learn from the past is 
beneficial in the planning stages of an activity. But execution of the resulting 
plan is also critical, and it is here that humans frequently are found to be 
lacking. A significant driver of failure is a lack of discipline.
Many successful traders subscribe to the old trading adage: Cut losers and 
ride winners. However , discretionary investors often find it very difficult to re-
alize losses, whereas they are quick to realize gains. This is a well‐documented 
behavioral bias known as the disposition effect.
8 Computers, however , are not 
subject to this bias. As a result, a trader who subscribes to the aforementioned 

## Page 31

adage can easily program his trading system to behave in accordance with 
it every time. This is not because the systematic trader is somehow a better 
person than the discretionary trader , but rather because the systematic trader 
is able to make this rational decision at a time when there is no pressure, 
thereby obviating the need to exercise discipline at a time when most people 
would find it extraordinarily challenging. Discretionary investors can learn 
something about discipline from those who make it their business.
sUMM ary
Quant traders are a diverse and large portion of the global investment uni-
verse. They are found in both large and small trading shops and traffic in 
multiple asset classes and geographical markets. As is obvious from the 
magnitude of success and failure that is possible in quant trading, this niche 
can also teach a great deal to any curious investor . Most traders would be 
well served to work with the same kind of thoroughness and rigor that is 
required to properly specify and implement a quant trading strategy. Just 
as useful is the quant’s proclivity to measure risk and exposure to various 
market dynamics, though this activity must be undergone with great care 
to avoid its flaws. Finally, the discipline and consistency of implementation 
that exemplifies quant trading is something from which all decision makers 
can learn a great deal.

some simple input is rigorously tortured to arrive at a mysterious and dis-
tant output. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines a Rube 
Goldberg device as “accomplishing by extremely complex roundabout means 
what actually or seemingly could be done simply . ” Many observers in both 
the press and industry use markedly similar terms to describe quants. One 
Washington Post article, “For W all Street’s Math Brains, Miscalculations; 
Complex Formulas Used by ‘Quant’ Funds Didn’t Add Up in Market Down-

relies on complex and sophisticated mathematical algorithms to search for 
anomalies and non‐obvious patterns in the markets. ”

The term black box itself has somewhat mysterious origins. From what 
I can tell, its first known use was in 1915 in a sci‐fi serial called The Black 
Box, starring Herbert Rawlinson. The program was about a criminologist 
named Sanford Quest who invented devices (which themselves were placed 
inside a black box) to help him solve crimes. Universal Studios, which pro-
duced the serial, offered cash prizes to those who could guess the contents 
of the black box.
4
This connotation of opaqueness still persists today whenever the term 
black box is used. Most commonly in the sciences and in finance, a black 
box refers to any system that is fed inputs and produces outputs, but whose 
inner workings are either unknown or unknowable. Appropriately, two fa-
vorite descriptors for quant strategies are complex and secretive. However , 
by the end of this book I think it will be reasonably obvious to readers that, 
for the most part, quantitative trading strategies are in fact clear boxes that 
are far easier to understand in most respects than the caprice inherent to 
most human decision making.
For example, an esoteric‐sounding strategy called statistical arbitrage is 
in fact simple and easily understood. Statistical arbitrage (stat arb) is based 
on the theory that similar instruments (imagine two stocks, such as Exxon 
Mobil and Chevron) should behave similarly. If their relative prices diverge 
over the short run, they are likely to converge again. So long as the stocks 
are still similar , the divergence is more likely due to a short‐term imbalance 
between the amount of buying and selling of these instruments, rather than 
any meaningful fundamental change that would warrant a divergence in 
prices. This is a clear and straightforward premise, and it drives billions 
of dollars’ worth of trading volumes daily. It also happens to be a strategy 
that discretionary traders use, though it is usually called pairs trading. But 
whereas the discretionary trader is frequently unable to provide a curious 
investor with a consistent and coherent framework for determining when 
two instruments are similar or what constitutes a divergence, these are ques-
tions that the quant has likely researched and can address in great detail.
Wha T  Is a Quan T ?
A quant systematically applies an alpha‐seeking investment strategy that 
is specified based on exhaustive research. What makes a quant a quant, in 
other words, almost always lies in how an investment strategy is conceived 
and implemented. It is rarely the case that quants are different from dis-
cretionary traders in what their strategies are actually doing, as illustrated 
by the earlier example of pairs trading and statistical arbitrage. There is al-
most never any attempt to eliminate human contributions to the investment 

## Page 35

An Introduction to Quantitative Trading  15
process; after all, we are talking about quants, not robots. As previously 
mentioned, although quants apply mathematics and/or computer science 
to a wide variety of strategies, whether a fund designed to track the S&P 
500 (i.e., an index fund) or to structure exotic products (e.g., asset‐backed 
securities, credit default swaps, or principal protection guarantee notes), this 
book will remain focused on quants who pursue alpha, or returns that are 
independent of the direction of any market in the long run.
Besides conceiving and researching the core investment strategy, hu-
mans also design and build the software and systems used to automate the 
implementation of their ideas. But once the system “goes live,” human judg-
ment is generally limited in the day‐to‐day management of a portfolio. Still, 
the importance of human discretion in such a setup should not be under -
stated. Good judgment is actually what separates the best quants from the 
mediocre. The kinds of issues listed in the stat arb example are just a small 
subset of the kinds of decisions that quants almost always have to make, 
and these fundamental decisions, above all else, drive the strategy’s behavior 
from that time forward. As such, good and bad judgments are multiplied 
over and over through time as the computer faithfully implements exactly 
what it was told to do. This is no different from many other fields. Imagine a 
guided missile system. If the engineers make bad judgments in the way they 
design these systems, there can be disastrous results, which are multiplied as 
more missiles are fired using the faulty guidance systems.
T o understand the systematic nature of quants better , it can be helpful to 
examine the frontiers of the systematic approach—in other words, the situa-
tions in which quants have to abandon a systematic approach for a discretion-
ary one. When a quant intervenes with the execution of her strategy , it is most 
commonly to mitigate problems caused by information that drives market 
behavior but that cannot be processed by the model. For example, the 2008 
merger between Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, which caused Merrill’s 
price to skyrocket, might have led a naïve quant strategy to draw the conclu-
sion that Merrill had suddenly become drastically overpriced relative to other 
banks and was therefore an attractive candidate to be sold short. But this 
conclusion would have been flawed because there was information that justi-
fied the spike in Merrill’s price and would not seem to a reasonable person to 
lead to a short sale. As such, a human can step in and simply remove Merrill 
from the universe that the computer models see, thereby eliminating the risk 
that, in this case anyway , the model will make decisions based on bad infor-
mation. In a sense, this is merely an application of the principle of “garbage 
in, garbage out. ” If a portfolio manager at a quant trading shop is concerned 
that the model is making trading decisions based on inaccurate, incomplete, 
or irrelevant information, she may decide to reduce risk by eliminating trad-
ing in the instruments affected by this information.

## Page 36

16  The Quan T  u niverse
Note that in this example, the news of the merger would already have 
been announced before the quant decides to override the system. Some 
shops are more aggressive, preemptively pulling names off the list of trad-
able securities at the first sign of credible rumors. By contrast, other quants 
do not remove names under any circumstances. Many quants reserve the 
right to reduce the overall size of the portfolio (and therefore leverage) if, in 
their discretion, the markets appear too risky. For example, after the attacks 
of September 11, 2001, many quants reduced their leverage in the wake of 
a massive event that would have unknowable repercussions on capital mar-
kets. Once things seemed to be operating more normally in the markets, the 
quants increased their leverage back to normal levels.
Though the operating definition of quants at the beginning of this sec-
tion is useful, there is a full spectrum between fully discretionary strategies 
and fully systematic (or fully automated) strategies. The key determination 
that puts quants on one side of this spectrum and everyone else on the other 
is whether daily decisions about the selection and sizing of portfolio posi-
tions are made systematically (allowing for the exceptions of “emergency” 
overrides such as those just described) or by discretion. If both the ques-
tions of what positions to own and how much of each to own are usually 
answered systematically, that’s a quant. If either one is answered by a human 
as standard operating procedure, that’s not a quant.
It is interesting to note that, alongside the growth in quantitative trad-
ing, there are also a growing number of quasi‐quant traders. For instance, 
some of these traders utilize automated systems to screen for potential in-
vestment opportunities, thereby winnowing a large number of potential 
choices down to a much smaller , more manageable list. From there, hu-
man discretion kicks in again, doing some amount of “fundamental” work 
to determine which names selected by the systematic screening process are 
actually worth owning and which are not. Less commonly, some traders 
leave the sourcing and selection of trades entirely up to humans, instead 
using computers to optimize and implement portfolios and to manage risk. 
Still less commonly, a few traders allow the computer to pick all the trades, 
while the human trader decides how to allocate among these trades. These 
quasi‐quants make use of a subset of the tools in a proper quant’s toolbox, 
so we will cover their use of these techniques implicitly.

The best way to understand both quants and their black boxes is to examine 
the components of a quant trading system; this is the structure we will use

for the remainder of the book. Exhibit 2.1 shows a schematic of a typical 
quantitative trading system. This diagram portrays the components of a live, 
“production” trading strategy (e.g., the components that decide which secu-
rities to buy and sell, how much, and when) but does not include everything 
necessary to create the strategy in the first place (e.g., research tools for 
designing a trading system).
The trading system has three modules—an alpha model, a risk model, 
and a transaction cost model—which feed into a portfolio construction 
model, which in turn interacts with the execution model. The alpha model 
is designed to predict the future of the instruments the quant wants to con-
sider trading for the purpose of generating returns. For example, in a trend‐
following strategy in the futures markets, the alpha model is designed to 
forecast the direction of whatever futures markets the quant has decided to 
include in his strategy.
Risk models, by contrast, are designed to help limit the amount of expo-
sure the quant has to those factors that are unlikely to generate returns but 
could drive losses. For example, the trend follower could choose to limit his 
directional exposure to a given asset class, such as commodities, because of 
concerns that too many forecasts he follows could line up in the same direc-
tion, leading to excess risk; the risk model would contain the levels for these 
commodity exposure limits.
The transaction cost model, which is shown in the box to the right of 
the risk model in Exhibit 2.1, is used to help determine the cost of whatever 
trades are needed to migrate from the current portfolio to whatever new 
portfolio is desirable to the portfolio construction model. Almost any trad-
ing transaction costs money, whether the trader expects to profit greatly or 
a little from the trade. Staying with the example of the trend follower , if a

trend is expected to be small and last only a short while, the transaction cost 
model might indicate that the cost of entering and exiting the trade is greater 
than the expected profits from the trend.
The alpha, risk, and transaction cost models then feed into a portfolio 
construction model, which balances the trade‐offs presented by the pursuit 
of profits, the limiting of risk, and the costs associated with trading, thereby 
determining the best portfolio to hold. Having made this determination, 
the system can compare the current portfolio to the new target portfolio, 
with the differences between the current portfolio and the target portfolio 
representing the trades that need to be executed. Exhibit 2.2 illustrates an 
example of this process.
The current portfolio reflects the positions the quant trader currently 
owns. After running the portfolio construction model, the quant trader gen-
erates the new target portfolio weights, shown in the New T arget Portfolio 
column. The difference between the two indicates the trades that now need 
to be executed, which is the job of the execution algorithm. The execution 
algorithm takes the required trades and, using various other inputs such as the 
urgency with which the trades need to be executed and the dynamics of the 
liquidity in the markets, executes trades in an efficient and low‐cost manner .
The structure shown in Exhibit 2.1 is by no means universal. For exam-
ple, many quant strategies are run without a transaction cost model, a port-
folio construction model, or an execution model. Others combine various 
components of these models. One can build whatever risk requirements and 
constraints are considered necessary into the alpha model itself. Another 
variation is to create more recursive connections among the pieces. Some 
traders capture data about their actual executions and utilize these data 
to improve their transaction cost models. However , the diagram is useful 
because, for the most part, it captures the various discrete functions within 
a quant trading system, regardless of whether they are organized precisely 
in this manner .

An Introduction to Quantitative Trading  19
Exhibit 2.1 captures only part of the work of the quant trader because it 
considers only the live production trading system and ignores two key pieces 
required to build it and run it: data and research. Black boxes are inert and 
useless without data—accurate data, moreover . Quant traders build input/
output models that take inputs (data), process this information, and then 
produce trading decisions. For example, a trader utilizing a trend‐following 
strategy usually requires price data to determine what the trend is. Without 
data, he would have nothing to do, because he’d never be able to identify 
the trends he intends to follow. As such, data are the lifeblood of quants and 
determine much about their strategies. Given data, quants can perform re-
search, which usually involves some form of testing or simulation. Through 
research, the quant can ascertain whether and how a quant strategy works. 
We also note that each of the other modules in our schematic, when built 
correctly, usually requires a great deal of research. We can therefore redraw 
our diagram to include these other critical pieces, as shown in Exhibit 2.3.

Quants are perhaps not so mysterious as is generally supposed. They tend 
to start with ideas that any reasonable observer of the markets might also 
have, but rather than using anecdotal, experiential evidence—or worse, sim-
ply assuming that their ideas are true—quants use market data to feed a 
research process to determine whether their ideas in fact hold true over time.

into a quant system. These systems take the emotion out of investing and 
instead impose a disciplined implementation of the idea that was tested. But 
this should not be read as minimizing the importance of human beings in 
the quant trading process. Quants come up with ideas, test strategies, and 
decide which ones to use, what kinds of instruments to trade, at what speed, 
and so on. Humans also tend to control a “panic button,” which allows 
them to reduce risk if they determine that markets are behaving in some way 
that is outside the scope of their models’ capabilities.
Quant strategies are widely ignored by investors as being opaque and 
incomprehensible. Even those who do focus on this niche tend to spend 
most of their time understanding the core of the strategy, its alpha model. 
But we contend that there are many other parts of the quant trading process 
that deserve to be understood and evaluated. Transaction cost models help 
determine the correct turnover rate for a strategy, and risk models help keep 
the strategy from betting on the wrong exposures. Portfolio construction 
models balance the conflicting desires to generate returns, expend the right 
amount on transaction costs, manage risk, and deliver a target portfolio to 
execution models, which implement the portfolio model’s decisions. All this 
activity is fed by data and driven by research. From afar , we have begun to 
shed light on the black box.
Next, in Part Two, we will dissect each of these modules, making our 
way methodically through the inside of the black box. At the end of each of 
these chapters, as a reminder of the structure of a quant system and of our 
progress, we will indicate the topic just completed by removing the shading 
from it.

Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.

aving surveyed it from the outside, we begin our journey through the 
black box by understanding the heart of the actual trading systems that 
quants use. This first piece of a quant trading system is its alpha model, 
which is the part of the model that is looking to make money and is where 
much of the research process is focused. Alpha, the spelled‐out version of the 
Greek letter α, generally is used as a way to quantify the skill of an investor 
or the return she delivers independently of the moves in the broader market. 
By conventional definition, alpha is the portion of the investor’s return not 
due to the market benchmark, or, in other words, the value added (or lost) 
solely because of the manager. The portion of the return that can be attrib-
uted to market factors is then referred to as beta. For instance, if a manager 
is up 12 percent and her respective benchmark is up 10 percent, a quick 
back‐of‐the‐envelope analysis would show that her alpha, or value added, 
is +2 percent (this assumes that the beta of her portfolio was exactly 1). The 
flaw with this approach to computing alpha is that it could be a result of 
luck, or it could be because of skill. Obviously, any trader will be interested 
in making skill the dominant driver of the difference between her returns 
and the benchmark’s. Alpha models are merely a systematic approach to 
adding skill to the investment process in order to make profits. For example, 
a trend‐following trader’s ability to systematically identify trends that will 
persist into the future represents one type of skill that can generate profits.
Our definition of alpha—which I stress is not conventional—is skill in 
timing the selection and/or sizing of portfolio holdings. A pursuit of alpha

holds as a core premise that no instrument is inherently good or bad, and 
therefore no instrument is worth always owning or perpetually shorting. 
The trend follower determines when to buy and sell various instruments, as 
does the value trader. Each of these is a type of alpha. In the first case, al-
pha is generated from the skill in identifying trends, which allows the trend 
follower to know when it is good to be long or short a given instrument. 
Similarly, a value trader does not say that a given stock is cheap now and 
therefore is worth owning in perpetuity. In fact, if a stock is always cheap, it 
is almost certainly not worth owning, because its valuation never improves 
for the investor. Instead, the idea behind value investing is to buy a stock 
when it is undervalued and to sell it when it is fairly valued or overvalued. 
Again, this represents an effort to time the stock.
The software that a quant builds and uses to conduct this timing sys-
tematically is known as an alpha model, though there are many synonyms 
for this term: forecast, factor, alpha, model, strategy, estimator, or predictor. 
All successful alpha models are designed to have some edge, which allows 
them to anticipate the future with enough accuracy that, after allowing for 
being wrong at least sometimes and for the cost of trading, they can still 
make money. In a sense, of the various parts of a quant strategy, the alpha 
model is the optimist, focused on making money by predicting the future.
To make money, generally some risk, or exposure, must be accepted. 
By utilizing a strategy, we directly run the risk of losing money when the 
environment for that strategy is adverse. For example, Warren Buffett has 
beaten the market over the long term, and this differential is a measure of 
his alpha. But there have been times when he struggled to add value, as he 
did during the dot‐com bubble of the late 1990s. His strategy was out of 
favor, and his underperformance during this period reflected this fact. In the 
case of alpha models, the same holds true: Whatever exposures they take on 
are rewarding if they are in favor, and are costly if they are out of favor. This 
chapter addresses the kinds of alpha models that exist and the ways that 
quants actually use the forecasts their models make.

An important and not widely understood fact is that only a small number 
of trading strategies exist for someone seeking alpha. But these basic 
strategies can be implemented in many ways, making it possible to create an 
incredible diversity of strategies from a limited set of core ideas. The first key 
to understanding quant trading strategies is to understand the perspectives 
quants take on science.

## Page 45

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  25
Because most quants are trained first in the sciences and only later in 
finance, quants’ scientific backgrounds frequently determine the approach 
they take to trading over their entire careers. The two major branches of sci-
ence are theoretical and empirical. Theoretical scientists try to make sense of 
the world around them by hypothesizing why it is the way it is. This is the 
kind of science with which people are most familiar and interact most. For 
example, viable, controllable, long‐distance airplanes exist largely because 
engineers apply theories of aerodynamics. Empirical scientists believe that 
enough observations of the world can allow them to predict future patterns 
of behavior, even if there is no hypothesis to rationalize the behavior in an 
intuitive way. In other words, knowledge comes from experience. The Hu-
man Genome Project is one of many important examples of the applications 
of empirical science, mapping human traits to the sequences of chemical 
base pairs that make up human DNA.
The distinction between theoretical and empirical science is germane to 
quantitative trading in that there are also two kinds of quant traders. The 
first, and by far the more common, are theory driven. They start with ob-
servations of the markets, think of a generalized theory that could explain 
the observed behavior, and then rigorously test it with market data to see if 
the theory is shown to be either untrue or supported by the outcome of the 
test. In quant trading, most of these theories would make sense to you or me 
and would seem sensible when explained to friends at cocktail parties. For 
example, “cheap stocks outperform expensive stocks” is a theory that many 
people hold. This explains the existence of countless value funds. Once pre-
cisely defined, this theory can be tested.
The second kind of scientist, by far in the minority, believes that correctly 
performed empirical observation and analysis of the data can obviate the need 
for theory. Such a scientist’s theory, in short, is that there are recognizable pat-
terns in the data that can be detected with careful application of the right tech-
niques. Again, the example of the Human Genome Project is instructive. The 
scientists in the Human Genome Project did not believe that it was necessary 
to theorize what genes were responsible for particular human traits. Rather, 
scientists merely theorized that the relationships between genes and traits can 
be mapped using statistical techniques, and they proceeded to do exactly that. 
Empirical scientists are sometimes derisively (and sometimes just as a matter 
of fact) labeled data miners. They don’t especially care if they can name their 
theories and instead attempt to use data analysis techniques to uncover be -
haviors in the market that aren’t intuitively obvious.
It is worthwhile to note that theory‐driven scientists (and quants) are 
also reliant on observations (data) to derive theories in the first place. Just 
like the empiricists, they, too, believe that something one can observe in the 
data will be repeatable in the future. Empiricists, however, are less sensitive 

## Page 46

26  Ins I de the Black Box
to whether their human minds can synthesize a story to explain the data 
even if, in the process, they risk finding relationships or patterns in the data 
that are entirely spurious.
tH eory- d r I ven a l PH a Models
Most quants you will come across are theory driven. They start with some 
economically feasible explanation of why the markets behave in a certain 
way and test these theories to see whether they can be used to predict the fu-
ture with any success. Many quants think that their theories are somewhat 
unique to them, which is part of the reason so many of them are so secre-
tive. But this turns out, almost always, to be a delusion. Meanwhile, many 
outside the quant trading world believe that the kinds of strategies quants 
use are complex and based on complicated mathematical formulae. This 
generally also turns out to be false.
In fact—and in defiance of both the presumed need for secrecy and the 
claims that what quants do cannot be understood by those without doctor-
ate degrees—most of what theory‐driven quants do can be relatively easily 
fit into one of six classes of phenomena: trend, reversion, technical senti-
ment, value/yield, growth, and quality. It is worth noting that the kinds of 
strategies that quants utilize are actually exactly the same as those that can 
be utilized by discretionary traders seeking alpha. These six categories can 
be further understood by examining the data that they use: price‐related 
data and fundamental data. As we will see throughout this book, under -
standing the inputs to a strategy is extremely important to understanding 
the strategy itself. The first two categories of strategies, trend and mean 
reversion, are based on price‐related data. Technical sentiment strategies are 
less commonly found, but can be thought of as a third class of price‐based 
strategies. The remaining three strategies, value/yield, growth/sentiment, 
and quality, are based on fundamental and/or fundamental sentiment data.
Many successful quants utilize more than one type of alpha model in 
conjunction, but to gain a proper understanding of these strategies, we will 
first break them down individually and discuss the combination of them 
afterward. Exhibit 3.1 provides a summary and outline for understanding 
the types of alpha models that quants use.
s trategies Utilizing Price- r elated d ata
First we will focus on alpha models that utilize price‐related data, which 
are mostly about the prices of various instruments or other information 
that generally comes from an exchange (such as trading volume). Quants

who seek to forecast prices and to profit from such forecasts are likely to be 
exploiting one of two kinds of phenomena. The first is that an established 
trend will continue, and the second is that the trend will reverse. In other 
words, the price can either keep going in the direction it was going already, 
or it can go in the opposite direction. We call the first idea trend following or 
momentum, and we call the second idea counter‐trend or mean reversion. A 
third idea will be explored as well, which we refer to as technical sentiment. 
This is a far less common type of alpha, but which deserves some discussion.

Trend following is based on the theory that markets some-
times move for long enough in a given direction that one can identify this 
trend and ride it. The economic rationale for the existence of trends is based 
on the idea of consensus building among market participants. Imagine that 
there is uncertainty about the medium‐term outlook for the U.S. economy. 
The labor picture looks fine, but inflation is running rampant, and trade 
deficits are blooming. On the other hand, consumers are still spending, and 
housing is strong. This conflicting information is a regular state of affairs 
for economies and markets, so that some of the information available ap-
pears favorable and some unfavorable. In our example, let’s further imagine 
that the bears have it right—that in fact inflation will get out of control and 
cause problems for the economy. The earliest adopters of this idea place 
their trades in accordance with it by, for example, selling bonds short. As 
more and more data come out to support their thesis and as a growing mass 
of market participants adopts the same thesis, the price of U.S. bonds may 
take a considerable amount of time to move to its new equilibrium, and this 
slow migration from one equilibrium to the next is the core opportunity that 
the trend follower looks to capture.

It bears mentioning that there is an alternate explanation of why trends 
happen; it is affectionately known as the greater fools theory. The idea here 
is that, because people believe in trends, they tend to start buying anything 
that’s been going up and selling anything that’s been going down, which 
itself perpetuates the trend. The key is always to sell your position to some-
one more foolish, and thereby to avoid being the last fool. Either theoretical 
explanation, coupled with the evidence in markets, seems a valid enough 
reason to believe in trends.
Trend followers typically look for a “significant” move in a given direc-
tion in an instrument. They bet that, once a significant move has occurred, it 
will persist because this significant move is a likely sign of a growing consen-
sus (or a parade of fools). They prefer this significance because a great risk 
of trend‐following strategies is whipsawing action in markets, which de-
scribes a somewhat rapid up‐and‐down pattern in prices. If, in other words, 
you buy the S&P because it was up over the past three months (and, sym-
metrically, sell short the S&P every time it was down over the three months 
prior), you need the trend to keep going in the same direction after the 
three‐month observation period. If the S&P reverses direction roughly every 
three months, a strategy such as this would lose money on more or less every 
trade over that period. There are many ways of defining what kind of move 
is significant, and the most common terms used to describe this act of defini-
tion are filtering and conditioning. This turns out to be an important source 
of differentiation among the various players who pursue trend‐following 
strategies and will be explored further in “Implementing the Strategies.”
Perhaps the most obvious and well‐known example of a strategy that de-
pends on trends is in the world of futures trading, also known as managed 
futures or commodities trading advisors (CTAs). Exhibit 3.2 illustrates the 
downward trend in equities that began in the fourth quarter of 2007. One way 
to define a trend for trading purposes, known as a moving average crossover 
indicator, is to compare the average price of the index over a shorter time pe-
riod (e.g., 60 days) to that of a longer time period (e.g., 200 days). When the 
shorter‐term average price is below the longer‐term average price, the index 
is said to be in a negative trend, and when the shorter‐term average price is 
above the longer‐term average, the index is in a positive trend. As such, a trend 
follower using this kind of strategy might have gotten short the S&P Index 
around the end of 2007, as indicated by the point at which the two moving 
averages cross over each other, and remained short for most or all of 2008.
Some of the largest quantitative asset managers engage in trend fol-
lowing in futures markets, which also happens to be the oldest of all quant 
trading strategies, as far as I can tell. Ed Seykota built the first computerized 
version of the mechanical trend‐following strategy that Richard Donchian 
created some years earlier, utilizing punch cards on an IBM mainframe in

1970, a year after he graduated from MIT. He was a strong believer in doing 
ongoing research, and over the course of his first 12 years, he turned $5,000 
into $15,000,000. He went on to a highly successful three‐decade‐long 
career, over which he annualized some 60 percent returns.

Larry Hite represents another interesting example of an early practi -
tioner of trend following. Previously, Hite was a rock promoter in New 
York who, after experiencing three separate nightclub shootings on a sin -
gle night, decided a change of career was in order. In 1972, he coauthored 
a paper that suggested how game theory could be used to trade the futures 
markets using quantitative systems.
2 After turning his attention to trend 
following, he created Mint Investments in 1981 with two partners; it be -
came the first hedge fund to manage $1 billion and the first fund to part -
ner with the Man Group, which effectively put Man into the hedge fund 
business. Mint annualized north of 30 percent per year, net of fees, for its 
investors over the 13 years it existed under Hite’s stewardship. Notably, 
Mint made some 60 percent in 1987, in no small part by being on the right 
side of the crash that October.

Lest it seem like this is an overly rosy picture of trend following, it 
should be stated clearly: These strategies come with a great deal of risk 
alongside their lofty returns. The typical successful trend follower earns less 
than one point of return for every point of downside risk delivered. In other 
words, to earn 50 percent per year, the investor must be prepared to suffer

a loss greater than 50 percent at some point. In short, the returns of this 
strategy are streaky and highly variable.
This is not only true of trend following. Indeed, each of the major class-
es of alpha described in this chapter is subject to relatively long periods of 
poor returns. This is because the behaviors they seek to profit from in the 
markets are not ever‐present but rather are unstable and episodic. The idea 
is to make enough money in the good times and manage the downside well 
enough in the bad times to make the whole exercise worthwhile.
Perhaps quant trading’s most important trend follower in terms of 
lasting impact was a firm called Axcom, which later became Renaissance 
Technologies. Elwyn Berlekamp, a PhD in engineering from MIT, in 1986 
began to consult for Axcom regarding strategy development. Axcom had 
been struggling during those years, and Berlekamp bought a controlling 
interest. In 1989, after doing considerable research, Axcom resumed trad -
ing with a new and improved strategy. For its first year, the firm was up 55 
percent after charging 5 percent management fees and 20 percent incen -
tive fees. At the end of 1990, Berlekamp sold his interest to Jim Simons 
for a sixfold profit, which might still have been one of the worst trades in 
history. Renaissance, as the firm was called by then, is now the most suc -
cessful quant trading firm and probably the most impressive trading firm 
of any kind. It has evolved a great deal from the trend‐following strategies 
it used in the mid‐1980s and even from the more sophisticated futures 
strategies it employed in the early 1990s. It stopped accepting new money 
with less than $300 million under management in 1992 and went on to 
compound this money to approximately $10 billion some 20 years later, 
despite eye‐popping 5 percent management fees and 44 percent incentive 
fees. They have annualized approximately 35 percent per year net of these 
fees, from 1989 onward, and perhaps most astonishingly, have gotten bet-
ter over the years, despite the increased competition in the space and their 
own significantly larger capital base.

It is worth pointing out that quants are not the only ones who have a 
fondness for trend‐following strategies. It has always been and will likely 
remain one of the more important ways in which traders of all stripes go 
about their business. One can find trend following in the roots of the in-
famous Dutch tulip mania in the seventeenth century, or in the dot‐com 
bubble of the late twentieth century, neither of which is likely to have been 
caused by quants. And, of course, many discretionary traders have a strong 
preference to buy what’s been hot and sell what’s been cold.
Mean

When prices move, as we have already said, they move in 
either the same direction they’ve been going or in the opposite. We have 
just described trend following, which bets on the former. Now we turn our 

## Page 51

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  31
attention to mean reversion strategies, which bet on prices moving in the 
opposite direction to that which had been the prevailing trend.
The theory behind mean reversion strategies is that there exists a center 
of gravity around which prices fluctuate, and it is possible to identify both 
this center of gravity and what fluctuation is sufficient to warrant making a 
trade. As in the case of trend following, there are several valid rationales for 
existence of mean reversion. First, there are sometimes short‐term imbalances 
among buyers and sellers due simply to liquidity requirements that lead to an 
instrument being over‐bought or over‐sold. To return to the example men -
tioned earlier, imagine that a stock has been added to a well‐followed index, 
such as the S&P 500. This forces any fund that is attempting to track the index 
to run out and buy the stock, and, in the short term, there might not be enough 
sellers at the old price to accommodate them. Therefore, the price moves up 
somewhat abruptly, which increases the probability that the price will reverse 
again at some point, once the excess demand from index buyers has subsided. 
Another rationale to explain the existence of mean‐reverting behavior is that 
market participants are not all aware of each other’s views and actions, and as 
they each place orders that drive a price toward its new equilibrium level, the 
price can overshoot due to excess supply or demand at any given time.
Regardless of the cause of the short‐term imbalance between supply and 
demand, mean reversion traders are frequently being paid to provide liquid-
ity because they are bucking current trends. This is sometimes explicitly true 
in terms of their execution techniques (which we discuss in more detail in 
Chapters 7 and 14). But regardless of execution tactics, mean reversion traders 
are indeed betting against momentum, and bear the risk of adverse selection.
Interestingly, trend and mean reversion strategies are not necessarily at 
odds with each other. Longer‐term trends can occur, even as smaller oscilla-
tions around these trends occur in the shorter term. In fact, some quants use 
both of these strategies in conjunction. Mean reversion traders must identify 
the current mean or equilibrium and then must determine what amount of 
divergence from that equilibrium is sufficient to warrant a trade. As in the 
case of trend following, there are many ways of defining the mean and the 
reversal. It is worth noting that when discretionary traders implement mean 
reversion strategies, they are typically known as contrarians.
Perhaps the best‐known strategy based on the mean reversion concept 
is known as statistical arbitrage (stat arb, for short), which bets on the con-
vergence of the prices of similar stocks whose prices have diverged. While 
Ed Thorp, founder of Princeton/Newport Partners was probably one of the 
earliest quantitative equity traders, the trading desk of Nunzio Tartaglia at 
Morgan Stanley was a pioneer of stat arb and would prove to have lasting 
impact on the world of finance. Tartaglia’s team included scientists such as 
Gerry Bamberger and David Shaw, and together they developed and evolved 

## Page 52

32  Ins I de the Black Box
a strategy that was based on the relative prices of similar stocks. Stat arb 
ushered in an important change in worldview, one that focused on whether 
Company A was over‐ or undervalued relative to Company B rather than 
whether Company A was simply cheap or expensive in itself. This important 
evolution would lead to the creation of many strategies based on forecasts of 
relative attractiveness, which is a topic we will address in greater detail shortly.
Exhibit 3.3 shows a simplified example of the mean‐reverting behavior 
evident between similar instruments, in this case Merrill Lynch (MER) and 
Charles Schwab (SCHW). As you can see, the spread between these two 
companies oscillates rather consistently in a reasonably narrow range for 
long periods. This effect allows a trader to wait for significant divergences 
and then bet on a reversion back to the equilibrium level.
Trend and mean reversion strategies represent a large portion of all 
quant trading. After all, price data are plentiful and always changing, pre-
senting the quant with many opportunities to trade. It may be interesting to 
note that trend and mean reversion, though they are theoretically opposite 
ideas, both seem to work. How is this possible? Largely, it’s possible because 
of different timeframes. It is obviously correct that both strategies can’t pos-
sibly be made to be exactly opposite while both making money at the same 
time. However, there is no reason to create both strategies to be exactly the 
same. Trends tend to occur over longer time horizons, whereas reversions 
tend to happen over shorter‐term time horizons. Exhibit 3.4 shows this ef-
fect in action. You can see that there are indeed longer‐term trends and

shorter‐term mean reversions that take place. In fact, you can also see that 
the strategies are likely to work well in different regimes. From 2000 to 
2002 and again in 2008, a trend strategy likely exhibits better perform-
ance, since the markets were trending very strongly during these periods. 
From 2003 to 2007, mean‐reverting behavior was more prevalent. Yet both 
strategies are likely to have made money for the period as a whole. This can 
also be examined on other time horizons, and in some cases, mean reversion 
strategies can work as the longer‐term indicator, while momentum can be 
used as a faster indicator.

Technical Sentiment. An interesting third class of price‐related strate-
gies tracks investor sentiment—expressed through price, volume, and vola-
tility behaviors—as an indicator of future returns. A word of caution before 
delving into these strategies is warranted. Unlike in the cases of momentum 
and mean reversion (or the fundamental strategies to be outlined later in 
this chapter), there is no clear economic rationale that gives birth to a strat-
egy. In other words, there are widely varying views on the value and use of 
sentiment information in forecasting. To some practitioners, a high degree 
of positive sentiment in some instrument would indicate that the instru-
ment is already overbought and therefore ready to decline. To others, high 
positive sentiment would indicate that the instrument has support to move 
higher. For still others, sentiment is only used as a conditioning variable (this 
concept will be discussed in more detail in “Conditioning Variables”), for 
example by utilizing a trend‐following strategy only if the volumes that were 
associated with the price movements were significant, whereas a low‐vol-
ume trend might be ignored. It is this last use of sentiment data that is most 
common. There are, however, several examples of technical sentiment strat-
egies that can be thought of as standalone ways to forecast future direction.
First is to look at the options markets to determine sentiment on the 
underlying. There are two separate “straightforward” ideas to explore here. 
One is to look at the volume of puts and calls, and to use this as an indi-
cator of sentiment. If puts have higher volumes relative to calls than they 
normally do, it might be an indicator that investors are worried about a 
downturn. If puts have lower volumes versus calls than normal, it might be 
a bullish sentiment indicator. A second example of options‐based sentiment 
in equities utilizes the implied volatilities of puts versus calls. It is natural 
to see some level of difference in the implied volatilities of puts versus calls. 
This is partially in recognition of the habit of stocks to move down quickly 
and up slowly, which would indicate that downside volatility is higher than 
upside volatility, which in turn causes the seller of a put option to demand a 
higher price (and therefore implied volatility) than would be demanded by 
the seller of a call option that is equally far out of the money (or in the case 
that they are both at the money). If one analyzes the historical ratio of put 
volatility and call volatility, there will likely be some natural ratio (greater 
than one, due to the phenomenon just described about upside and down-
side volatility), and divergences from this natural level might be treated as 
indicative of sentiment. A related idea would be to use implied volatility 
or a proxy (e.g., credit default swaps, or CDS for short) as an indicator of 
investor sentiment.
A second example of a technical sentiment strategy analyzes trading 
volume, open interest, or other related type of inputs as an indicator of 
future prices. At the shortest timeframes, some higher‐frequency traders 
evaluate the shape of the limit order book to determine near‐term sentiment. 

## Page 55

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  35
The shape of the order book includes factors such as the size of bids or of-
fers away from the mid‐market relative to the size at the best bid/offer, or 
the aggregate size of bids versus offers. For slightly longer‐term strategies, 
analyses of volume can include looking at the trading volume, the turnover 
(trading versus float), open interest, or other similar measures of trading ac-
tivity. As I mentioned at the outset of this section, what to do with this kind 
of information remains up for debate. It can be used as a contrarian indica-
tor (i.e., high-volume or high-turnover stocks are expected to underperform, 
while low volume or low turnover stocks are expected to outperform) or as 
a positive indicator. Most of the research I have reviewed, however, focuses 
on the contrarian approach.
s trategies Utilizing f undamental d ata
Most strategies utilizing fundamental data in their alpha models can be 
easily classified into one of three groups: value/yield, growth, or quality. 
Though these ideas are frequently associated with the analysis of equities, 
it turns out that one can apply the exact same logic to any kind of instru-
ment. A bond, a currency, a commodity, an option, or a piece of real estate 
can be bought or sold because it offers attractive value, growth, or quality 
characteristics. While fundamentals have long been part of the discretionary 
trader’s repertoire, quantitative fundamental strategies are relatively young.
In quantitative equity trading and in some forms of quantitative futures 
or macro trading, much is owed to Eugene Fama and Kenneth French (known 
better collectively as Fama‐French). In the early 1990s, they produced a series 
of papers that got quants thinking about the kinds of factors that quants fre-
quently use in strategies utilizing fundamental data. In particular, “The Cross 
Section of Expected Stock Returns” coalesced more than a decade of prior 
work in the area of using quantitative fundamental factors to predict stock 
prices and advanced the field dramatically.
5 Fama and French found, simply, 
that stocks’ betas to the market are not sufficient to explain the differences 
in the returns of various stocks. Rather, combining betas with historical data 
about the book‐to‐price ratio and the market capitalization of the stocks was 
a better determinant of future returns. It is somewhat ironic that an entire 
domain of quantitative alpha trading owes so much to Eugene Fama, because 
Fama’s most famous work advanced the idea that markets are efficient.

Value strategies are well known and are usually associated with 
equity trading, though such strategies can be used in other markets as well. 
There are many metrics that people use to describe value in various asset class-
es, but most of them end up being ratios of some fundamental factor versus 
the price of the instrument, such as the price‐to‐earnings (P/E) ratio. Quants 
tend to invert such ratios, keeping prices in the denominator. An inverted P/E 

## Page 56

36  Ins I de the Black Box
ratio, or an E/P ratio, is also known as earnings yield. Note that investors have 
long done this with dividends, hence the dividend yield, another commonly 
used measure of value. The basic concept of value strategies is that the higher 
the yield, the cheaper the instrument. The benefit of the conversion of ratios to 
yields is that it allows for much easier and more consistent analysis.
Let’s take earnings as an example: Earnings can (and frequently do) 
range from large negative numbers to large positive numbers and every-
where in between. If we take two stocks that are both priced at $20, but 
one has $1 of earnings while the other has $2 of earnings, it’s easy to see 
that the first has a 20 P/E and the second has a 10 P/E, so the second looks 
cheaper on this metric. But imagine instead that the first has –$1 in earn-
ings, whereas the second has –$2 in earnings. Now, these stocks have P/Es 
of –20 and –10. Having a –20 P/E seems worse than having a –10 P/E, but 
it’s clearly better to only have $1 of negative earnings than $2. Thus, using 
a P/E ratio is misleading in the case of negative earnings. In the case that 
a company happens to have produced exactly $0 in earnings, the P/E ratio 
is simply undefined, since we would be dividing by $0. Because ratios with 
price in the numerator and some fundamental figure in the denominator 
exhibit this sort of misbehavior, quants tend to use the inverted yield forms 
of these same ratios. This idea is demonstrated in Exhibit 3.5, which shows 
that the E/P ratio is well behaved for any level of earnings per share for a 
hypothetical stock with a price greater than $1 (in the example, we used

$20 per share as the stock price). By contrast, the P/E ratio is rather poorly 
behaved and does not lend itself well to analysis and is not even properly 
defined when earnings per share are zero.
There is a bigger theme implied by the example of the treatment of earn-
ings data by quants. Many fundamental quantities are computed or quoted 
in ways that are not readily used in developing a systematic alpha. These 
quantities predated the use of computers to trade, and as a result, can have 
arbitrary definitions and distributions. Quants must transform such data 
into more usable, well‐behaved variables that can lend themselves more 
readily to systematic trading applications.
Most often, value is thought of as a strategy that is defined by buying 
cheap. But this strikes me as being too shallow a definition. In reality, the idea 
behind value investing is that markets tend to overestimate the risk in risky in-
struments and possibly to underestimate the risk in less risky ones. Therefore, 
it can pay off to own the more risky asset and/or sell the less risky asset. The 
argument for this theory is that sometimes instruments have a higher yield 
than is justified by their fundamentals simply because the market is requiring 
a high yield for that kind of instrument at the moment. An investor who can 
purchase this instrument while it has a high yield can profit from the move-
ment over time to a more efficient, fair price. As it happens, instruments don’t 
usually become cheap solely because their prices don’t move while their fun-
damentals improve drastically. Rather, prices are more often the determinant 
of value than changing fundamentals, and in the case of a cheap instrument, 
this implies that the instrument’s price must have fallen substantially. So in 
some sense, the value investor is being paid to take on the risk of standing in 
the way of momentum. Ray Ball, a professor of accounting at the University 
of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, wrote a paper, “Anomalies in Rela-
tionships Between Securities’ Yields and Yield‐Surrogates,” which echoes the 
idea that higher‐yielding stocks—those with higher earnings yields—are likely 
those for which investors expect to receive higher returns and greater risks.
6
When done on a relative basis, that is, buying the undervalued secu-
rity and selling the overvalued one against it, this strategy is also known 
as a carry trade. One receives a higher yield from the long position and 
finances this with the short position, on which a lower yield must be paid. 
The spread between the yield received and the yield paid is the carry. For 
instance, one could sell short $1,000,000 of U.S. bonds and use the proceeds 
to buy $1,000,000 of higher‐yielding Mexican bonds. Graham and Dodd, 
in their landmark book Security Analysis, propose that value trading offers 
investors a margin of safety. In many respects, this margin of safety can be 
seen clearly in the concept of carry. If nothing else happens, a carry trade of-
fers an investor a baseline rate of return, which acts as the margin of safety 
Graham and Dodd were talking about.

Carry trading is an enormously popular kind of strategy for quants 
(and discretionary traders) in currencies, where the currency of a country 
with higher short‐term yields is purchased against a short position in the 
currency of a country with relatively low short‐term yields. For example, 
if the European Central Bank’s target interest rate is set at 4.25 percent, 
whereas the U.S. Federal Reserve has set the Fed Funds rate at 2 percent, a 
carry trade would be to buy euros against the U.S. dollar. This is a classic 
value trade because the net yield is 2.25 percent (4.25 percent gained on the 
euro position, less 2 percent paid in U.S. interest), and this provides a margin 
of safety. If the trade doesn’t work, the first 2.25 percent of the loss on it is 
eliminated by the positive carry. Similar strategies are employed in trading 
bonds. In fact, this was one of Long‐Term Capital Management’s central 
trading ideas, until the firm imploded in 1998.
Note that, in currencies and in bonds, the connection between higher 
yields and higher risk is more widely understood than in equities. In other 
words, if some instrument has a higher yield than its peers, there may well 
be a good reason that investors demand this higher yield. The reason is usu-
ally that this instrument is more risky than its peers. This can naturally be 
seen in the juxtaposition of yields on government bonds, AAA‐rated corpo-
rate bonds, and various lower‐rated corporate bonds. As riskiness increases, 
so too do yields to compensate lenders.
Another important example of value trading is in equities, where many 
kinds of traders seek to define metrics of “cheapness,” such as earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) versus enterprise 
value (EV) or book value to price. Book value per share versus price ( book 
yield or book‐to‐price) is also a fairly common factor, as it has been among 
quants since Fama and French popularized it in their papers. Most quant 
equity traders who use value strategies are seeking relative value rather than 
simply making an assessment of whether a given stock is cheap or expensive. 
This strategy is commonly known as quant long/short (QLS). QLS traders 
tend to rank stocks according to their attractiveness based on various factors, 
such as value, and then buy the higher‐ranked stocks while selling short the 
lower‐ranked ones. For example, assume that we ranked the major integrated 
oil companies by the following hypothetical book‐to‐price ratios:
Company Book‐to‐Price Ratio (Hypothetical)
Marathon Oil (MRO) 95.2%
ConocoPhillips (COP) 91.7%
Chevron Corp. (CVX) 65.4%
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 33.9%

## Page 59

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  39
According to this metric, the higher‐ranked stocks might be candidates for 
long positions, whereas the lower‐ranked might be candidates for short posi-
tions. The presumption is that a stock with a higher book‐to‐price ratio might 
outperform stocks with lower book‐to‐price ratios over the coming quarters.
Value can be used to time any kind of instrument for which valuations 
can be validly measured. This is easier in instruments such as individual 
equities, equity indices, currencies, and bonds. In the case of most com-
modities, value is usually thought of more to a “cheap/expensive” analysis, 
via concepts of the expected supplies of a commodity versus the expected 
demand for that commodity, rather than being focused on yield. There are 
classes of strategies in the futures markets (not specifically commodity fu-
tures, but most often in that group) that focus on yield explicitly as well. 
Roll yield is the spread between the price of a futures contract with some 
expiry date in the future, versus that of the spot (or that of the contract with 
a shorter‐dated expiry). In backwardated markets, spot prices are higher 
than futures contracts as they extend out into the calendar. Because there is 
a convergence of futures contracts up to the spot price, futures in this situ-
ation are considered to have positive roll yield. In contango markets, spot 
prices are lower than futures, and so the yield is considered negative.
Growth/
s
entiment
 
Growth strategies seek to make predictions based on the 
asset in question’s expected or historically observed level of economic growth. 
Some examples of such ideas could be gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
or earnings growth. That a given stock is a growth asset implies nothing about 
its valuation or yield. The theory here is that, all else being equal, it is better to 
buy assets that are experiencing rapid economic growth and/or to sell assets 
that are experiencing slow or negative growth. Some growth metrics, such as 
the price/earnings‐to‐growth (PEG) ratio (PE ratio vs. EPS growth rate), are 
basically a forward‐looking concept of value; that is, they compare growth 
expectations to value expectations to see whether a given instrument is fairly 
pricing in the positive or negative growth that the trader believes the asset will 
likely experience. If you expect an asset to grow rapidly but the market has 
already priced the asset to account for that growth, there is no growth trade 
to be made. In fact, if the market has priced in a great deal more growth than 
you expect, it might even be reasonable to short the instrument. But certainly 
many forms of growth trading are simply focused on buying rapidly growing 
assets regardless of price and selling assets with stagnant or negative growth, 
even if they are very cheap (or offer high yields) already.
The justification for growth investing is that growth is typically experi-
enced in a trending manner, and the strongest growers are typically becoming 
more dominant relative to their competitors. In the case of a company, you 
could see the case being made that a strong grower is quite likely to be 

## Page 60

40  Ins I de the Black Box
in the process of winning market share from its weaker‐growing competi-
tors. Growth investors try to be early in the process of identifying growth 
and, hence, early in capturing the implied increase in the future stature of 
a company. We can see examples of both macroeconomic growth strategies 
and microeconomic growth strategies in the quant trading world. At the 
macro level, some foreign exchange trading concepts are predicated on the 
idea that it is good to be long currencies of countries that are experiencing 
relatively strong growth, because it is likely that these will have higher rela-
tive interest rates in the future than weaker‐growth or recession economies, 
which makes this a sort of forward‐looking carry trade.
In the quant equity world, the QLS community frequently also utilizes 
signals relating to growth to help diversify their alpha models. Note that an 
important variant of growth trading utilized by a wide variety of quants and 
discretionary equity traders focuses on analysts’ earnings estimate revisions 
(or other aspects of analyst sentiment, including price targets and recom-
mendation levels). Sell‐side analysts working at various brokerage houses 
publish their estimates and release occasional reports about the companies 
they cover. The thesis is identical to any other growth strategy, but the idea 
is to try to get an early glimpse of a company’s growth by using the analysts’ 
expectations rather than simply waiting for the company itself to report its 
official earnings results. Because this strategy depends on the views of mar-
ket analysts or economists, it is called a sentiment‐based strategy. The quant 
community does not universally agree that sentiment‐based strategies, such 
as the estimate revision idea just mentioned, are nothing more than vari-
ants of growth strategies, but it is my experience that these two are highly 
enough correlated in practice to warrant their being treated as close cousins. 
After all, too often Wall Street analysts’ future estimates of growth look a lot 
like extrapolations of recent historical growth.
Quality
 
The final kind of theory‐driven fundamental alpha is what I call 
quality. A quality investor believes that, all else being equal, it is better to 
own instruments that are of high quality and better to sell or be short in-
struments of poor quality. The justification for this strategy is that capital 
safety is important, and neither growth nor value strategies really capture 
this concept. A strategy focused on owning higher‐quality instruments may 
help protect an investor, particularly in a stressful market environment. Not 
coincidentally, these are frequently termed flight‐to‐quality environments. 
This kind of strategy is easily found in quant equity trading but not as com-
monly in macroeconomic types of quant trading, probably because, histori-
cally, countries were not thought of as being particularly risky. Given the 
unfolding crisis in Europe, we may begin to see quality models deployed in 
more macroeconomics‐oriented strategies.

## Page 61

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  41
I generally find that quality signals fall into one of five categories. First 
is leverage, which would indicate that, based on some measurement of lev-
erage, one should short higher-levered companies and go long less-levered 
companies, all else equal. An example from the QLS world might look at the 
debt‐to‐equity ratios of stocks to help determine which ones to buy and sell, 
the idea being that less‐leveraged companies are considered higher quality 
than more‐leveraged companies, all else equal.
A second kind of quality signal is diversity of revenue sources, which 
would find those companies or countries with more diverse sources of po-
tential growth to be of higher quality than those with fewer sources. So, all 
else equal, a company that makes money doing a wide variety of things for 
a variety of customers should be more stable than a company that makes ex-
actly one kind of widget for some narrow purpose. A special case of this re-
lates to the volatility of revenues (or, in the case of companies, profits). Here, 
taking the example of corporate earnings and stock prices, investors would 
prefer, all else equal, to own companies whose earnings are more stable (less 
volatile) relative to companies whose earnings are less stable (more volatile).
A third type of quality signal is management quality, which would 
tend to buy companies or countries that are led by better teams and sell 
those with worse teams. A great article in Vanity Fair relates to this very 
kind of signal. Entitled “Microsoft’s Lost Decade,” several key management 
missteps (according to the article’s author) are highlighted as leading to 
Microsoft’s fall from being the largest market capitalization company in the 
world to being a “barren wasteland.” As you might expect, given the types 
of information involved, this is one of the more difficult types of signals to 
quantify. However, there are measures found, for example, in companies’ 
financial statements, including changes in discretionary accruals (the idea 
being, the greater the increase in discretionary accruals, the more likely there 
are problems with the management’s stewardship of the company).
A fourth type of quality strategy is fraud risk, which would buy compa-
nies or countries where the risk of fraud is low, and sell those where the risk 
is greater. An example of this kind of strategy from the QLS world is an earn-
ings quality signal, which attempts to measure how close are a company’s 
true economic earnings (as measured by, say, the free cash flow) to the re-
ported earnings‐per‐share numbers. Such strategies especially gained promi-
nence in the wake of the accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002 (Enron and 
WorldCom, for example), which highlighted that sometimes publicly traded 
companies are run by folks who are trying harder to manage their financial 
statements than manage their companies.
A final type of strategy relates to the sentiment investors have regarding 
the quality of the issuer of an instrument (again, this can be a company or 
a country). Generally, quality‐related sentiment strategies are focused on a 

## Page 62

42  Ins I de the Black Box
forward‐looking assessment of the four quality categories above. In other 
words, one has a prospective view of changes in leverage, revenue diversity, 
management quality, or fraud risk. However, this type of strategy is not 
particularly common, as the signals would appear very sporadically, and 
because there are relatively few sources of sentiment regarding quality, it is 
also quite difficult to backtest and achieve any kind of statistical significance. 
In recent years, the growth of the CDS markets has provided a much more 
regularly available source of quality‐sentiment information. Some investors 
would also use implied volatility to serve this purpose, but implied volatili-
ties go up because the market itself goes down, because growth expectations 
are lowered, because a company disappoints expectations on their earnings 
announcement, or for any number of other reasons unrelated to the quality 
of the company itself.
Quality’s performance over time fluctuates greatly and is highly depend-
ent on the market environment. In 2008, quality was a particularly success-
ful factor in predicting the relative prices of banking stocks. In particular, 
some quality factors helped traders detect, avoid, and/or sell short those 
banks with the most leverage or the most exposure to mortgage‐related 
businesses, thereby allowing these traders to avoid or even profit from the 
2008 credit crisis. The aforementioned accounting scandals in the early 
2000s also would have been profitable for quality signals. However, for all 
that these strategies profit when things are very dire, they tend to do poorly 
when the markets are performing well, and terribly when the equity markets 
go into a state of euphoria.
We now have a summary of the ways that theory‐driven, alpha‐focused 
traders (including quants) can make money. To recap, price information can 
be used for trend or mean reversion strategies, whereas fundamental infor -
mation can be used for yield (better known as value), growth, or quality 
strategies. This is a useful framework for understanding quant strategies but 
also for understanding all alpha‐seeking trading strategies. The framework 
proposed herein provides a menu of sorts, from which a particular quant 
may “order,” creating his strategy. It is also a useful framework for quants 
themselves and can help them rationalize and group the signals they use into 
families. Quants sometimes fool themselves into thinking that there are a 
broader array of core alpha concepts than actually exist.
d ata- d r I ven a l PH a Models
We now turn our attention to data‐driven strategies, which were not includ-
ed in the taxonomy shown in Exhibit 3.1. These strategies are far less widely 
practiced for a variety of reasons, one of which is that they are significantly 

## Page 63

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  43
more difficult to understand and the mathematics are far more complicated. 
Data mining, when done well, is based on the premise that the data tell you 
what is likely to happen next, based on some patterns that are recognizable 
using certain analytical techniques. When used as alpha models, the inputs 
are usually sourced from exchanges (mostly prices), and these strategies 
typically seek to identify patterns that have some explanatory power about 
the future.
There are two advantages to these approaches. First, compared with 
theory‐driven strategies, data mining is considerably more technically chal-
lenging and far less widely practiced. This means that there are fewer com-
petitors, which is helpful. Because theory‐driven strategies are usually easy 
to understand and the math involved in building the relevant models is usu-
ally not very advanced, the barriers to entry are naturally lower. Neither 
condition exists in the case of data‐driven strategies, which discourages 
entry into this space. Second, data‐driven strategies are able to discern be-
haviors whether they have been already named under the banner of some 
theory or not, which allows them to discover that something happens with-
out having to understand why. By contrast, theory‐driven strategies capture 
the kinds of behavior that humans have identified and named already, which 
may limit them to the six categories described earlier in this section.
For example, many high‐frequency traders favor an entirely empirical, 
data‐mining approach when designing their short‐term trading strategies for 
equity, futures, and foreign exchange markets. These data‐mining strategies 
may be more successful in high frequency because, if designed well, they are 
able to discern how the market behaves without having to worry about the 
economic theory or rationalization behind this behavior. Since there is not 
much good literature at this time about the theoretical underpinnings of hu-
man and computerized trading behaviors at very short‐term time horizons 
(i.e., minutes or less), an empirical approach may actually be able to outper-
form a theoretical approach at this timescale. Furthermore, at this timescale 
there is so much more data to work with that the empirical researcher has a 
better chance of finding statistically significant results in his testing.
However, data‐mining strategies also have many shortcomings. The 
researcher must decide what data to feed the model. If he allows the 
model to use data that have little or no connection to what he is trying to 
forecast—for example, the historical phases of the moon for every day over 
the past 50 years as the input to a forecast of the price of the stock market—
he may find results that are seemingly significant but are in reality entirely 
spurious. Furthermore, if the researcher chooses the set of all data generally 
thought to be useful in predicting markets, the amount of searching the al-
gorithms must conduct is so enormous as to be entirely impractical. To run a 
relatively thorough searching algorithm over, say, two years of intraday tick

data, with a handful of inputs, might take a single computer processor about 
three months of continuous processing before it finds the combinations of 
data that have predictive power. If this was not difficult enough, whatever 
strategies are found in this manner require the past to look at least reason-
ably like the future, although the future doesn’t tend to cooperate with this 
plan very often or for very long. To deal with this problem, the data‐mining 
strategy requires nearly constant adjustment to keep up with the changes 
going on in markets, an activity that has many risks in itself.
A second problem is that generating alphas using solely data‐mining 
algorithms is a somewhat dubious exercise. The inputs are noisy, containing 
a great number of false signals that act like traps for data miners. In general, 
strategies that use data‐mining techniques to forecast markets do not work, 
though there are a few exceptions.
In spite of (or, perhaps, because of) the aforementioned challenges fac-
ing data‐driven quant strategies, there are traders who implement them, and 
it is worthwhile to understand some of what goes into these types of models. 
Let’s first frame the problem broadly. Data‐driven strategies look at the cur-
rent market conditions, search for similar conditions in the historical data, 
and determine the probability that a type of outcome will occur afterwards. 
The model will choose to make a trade when the historical probabilities are 
in favor of doing so, and otherwise will not.
It also bears mentioning that, as much as data‐driven quant strategies 
are often mathematically more difficult to understand, even here there is 
an analog within the discretionary trading world. Technical analysts, also 
known as “chartists” because of their use of price and/or volume graphs 
to detect market patterns, are also looking for repeated patterns in market 
behavior that lead to predictable outcomes.
So, if data mining quants are primarily looking at current market con-
ditions, searching the history for similar conditions, determining the prob-
abilities of various outcomes in the aftermath of that setup, and making 
trades in accordance with the probabilities, they must, at a minimum, ad-
dress several questions.
What defines the “current market condition”? Remember, with a quant 
trading strategy, there is no leeway to be vague. Telling one’s computer to 
“find me situations in the past that look like the situation right now” isn’t 
enough. One must specify precisely what “current” means and what “condi-
tion” means. In the case of “current,” and not to get too philosophical about 
the concept of time, but the present can refer to an instantaneous moment, 
or the last few minutes, or the last 10 years. There is no standard, and the 
quant must determine her preference in this regard. So, even in this most 
empirical, data‐driven quant strategy, discretion is a key aspect of the crea-
tion of a strategy. In the case of “condition,” do we mean merely some aspect 

## Page 65

of price behavior, or do volumes and/or fundamental characteristics matter 
also? This is not merely an academic question: It is easy to see that, whether 
one treats the price behavior of two small‐capitalization technology compa-
nies the same way as one treats the behavior of one of those companies ver-
sus that of a mega‐cap diversified financial firm is a matter of fundamental 
beliefs about how the market works.
What is the search algorithm used to find “similar” patterns? Hand in 
hand with this question is another: What does “similar” mean? And, also 
related: By what method does the algorithm determine the probability of the 
outcome? These are the least easily conceptualized and the most technical 
questions on the list. I can only say that choosing statistical techniques that 
are appropriate to the dataset is very obviously critical, and that the quant 
must be careful. One of the most common follies in quant trading is to apply 
a statistical tool to the wrong problem. There is a great deal of art and judg-
ment that pertains to this decision, making it difficult to generalize a good 
answer to this question.
How far into the past will the search be conducted? A decidedly more 
straightforward question, conceptually, is how far into the past to look for 
similar patterns. The trade-off is simple, and it pervades quant research (and 
discretionary investment management). On the one hand, more recent data 
matters a lot, because it is the most relevant to the immediate present and 
near future. While it’s debatable whether human behavior ever really chang-
es, it’s clear that technology, and therefore the way humans interact with 
one another, does evolve, and not only this, but it evolves faster as more 
time passes. Market structures, too, evolve. How relevant would data from 
the Buttonwood Tree era of the NYSE be to the current world of almost 
exclusively electronic exchanges? On the other hand, with data‐mining tech-
niques applied to such noisy datasets as capital markets present, statistical 
significance is always of paramount importance. The greater the amount 
of data, the greater one’s confidence is in the statistical conclusions drawn 
from the data, for most types of statistical tests. So, while the more recent 
past is more relevant, the more data, the merrier. The quant (and the inves-
tor examining the quant) must determine the appropriate balance between 
these conflicting traits of statistical analysis applied to systems with dynamic 
conditions.

There are not many ways for alpha‐focused traders to make money, whether 
they are quants or not. But the limited selection of sources of alpha does 
not imply that all quants choose one of a handful of phenomena and then

have a peer group to which they are substantively identical. There is in fact 
considerable diversity among alpha traders, far more so than may be evident 
at first glance.
This diversity stems from the way quants implement their strategies, 
and it is to this subject that we now turn our attention. There are many char-
acteristics of an implementation approach that bear discussion, including 
the forecast target, time horizon, bet structure, investment universe, model 
specification, and run frequency.
f orecast t arget
The first key component of implementation is to understand exactly what 
the model is trying to forecast. Models can forecast the direction, mag -
nitude, and/or duration of a move and furthermore can include an as -
signment of confidence or probability for their forecasts. Many models 
forecast direction only, most notably the majority of trend‐following strat -
egies in futures markets. They seek to predict whether an asset price will 
rise or fall, and nothing more. Still others have specific forecasts of the size 
of a move, either in the form of an expected return or a price target. Some 
models, though they are far less common, also seek to identify how long 
a move might take.
The signal strength is an important (but not ubiquitous) aspect of quant 
models. Signal strength is defined by an expected return and/or by confi-
dence. The larger the expected return (i.e., the further the price target is 
from the current price), the greater the strength of the signal, holding confi-
dence levels constant. Similarly, the more confidence in a signal, the greater 
the signal strength, holding expected returns constant. In general, though 
certainly not always, a higher level of signal strength results in a bigger bet 
being taken on a position. This is only rational. Imagine that you believe 
two stocks, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), both will go up, but 
you have either a higher degree of confidence or a larger expected return in 
the forecast for XOM. It stands to reason that you will generally be willing 
to take a bigger bet on XOM than on CVX because XOM offers a more 
certain and/or larger potential return. The same holds for quant models, 
which generally give greater credence to a forecast made with a relatively 
high degree of confidence or large expected return. This concept can also 
influence the approach a strategy will take to executing the trades resulting 
from signals with varying strengths, which we will address in Chapter 7. 
However, the use of signal strength also bears some caution. Very large sig-
nals are unusual, and therefore there may be less statistical confidence that 
the relationship between the forecast and the outcome have the same rela-
tionship as is the case with smaller signals.

ime Horizon
The next key component to understanding implementation of the alpha 
model is time horizon. Some quant models try to forecast literally micro-
seconds into the future; others attempt to predict behavior a year or more 
ahead. Most quant strategies have forecast horizons that fall in the range of 
a few days to several months. Notably, a strategy applied to the very short 
term can look quite different from the way it would if the exact same idea 
was applied to the very long term, as illustrated by Exhibit 3.6. As you can 
see, a “medium‐term” version of the moving‐average‐based trend‐following 
strategy would have been short the S&P 500 index during the entirety of 
April and May 2008 because of the downtrend in the markets that began 
in October 2007. By contrast, as shown in the lower graph in Exhibit 3.6, a 
shorter‐term version of the same strategy would have been long on the S&P 
for all but three days in mid‐April and for the last days of May. This exhibit 
illustrates that the same strategy, applied over different time horizons, can 
produce markedly different—even opposite—positions.
In general, there is more variability between the returns of a one‐
minute strategy and a one‐hour strategy than between a three‐month and 
a six‐month strategy, even though the interval between the latter pair is 
significantly longer than that between the first pair. Generalized, we find 
that differentiation is greater at shorter timescales than at longer ones. This 
general rule especially holds true in more risky environments. This hap-
pens because the shorter‐term strategies are making very large numbers of 
trades compared with the longer‐term versions of the same strategies. Even 
a small difference in the time horizon of a strategy, when it is being run at 
a short timescale, can be amplified across tens of thousands of trades per 
day and in the millions per year. By contrast, three‐ and six‐month versions 
of the same strategy are simply making a lot fewer trades, so the difference 
in time horizon does not get amplified. So, for example, a 150‐day moving 
average versus a 300‐day moving average trend‐following strategy would 
produce the exact same constant short position in the S&P 500 during April 
and May 2008 as the trend‐following strategy that uses 60‐ and 100‐day 
moving averages. By contrast, taking merely 10 days off of the longer mov-
ing average from the shorter‐term system so that it now uses 5‐ and 10‐day 
moving averages causes the system to be short the S&P for several extra 
days in mid‐April and to add another short trade in mid‐May that the 5‐/20‐
day version would not have done. Instead of being short the S&P for eight 
trading days out of the total of 43 during these two months, the 5‐/10‐day 
version would be short for 15 out of the 43 days.
The choice of time horizon is made from a spectrum with a literally 
infinite number of choices; that is, forecasts can be made for two weeks 

## Page 68

into the future, or for two weeks and 30 seconds, or for two weeks and 
31 seconds, and so on. Yet adding 30 or 31 seconds to a forecast of two 
weeks might not cause a great deal of differentiation. Along this line of 
thinking, a classification may be helpful in understanding the distinctions 
among quant trading strategies by time horizon. High‐frequency strate -
gies are the fastest, making forecasts that go no further than the end of

the current trading day. Short‐term strategies, the second category, tend to 
hold positions from one day to two weeks. Medium‐term strategies make 
forecasts anywhere from a few weeks to a few months ahead. Finally, long‐
term strategies hold positions for several months or longer. The lines of 
demarcation between these groups are arbitrary, but in my experience, this 
shorthand can be helpful in thinking about how various quant strategies 
might compare with one another.
Bet s tructure
The next key component of an alpha model is bet structure, which, in turn, 
is based on how the alpha model generates its forecast. Models can be made 
to forecast either an instrument in itself or an instrument relative to others. 
For example, a model could forecast that gold is cheap and its price is likely 
to rise or that gold is cheap relative to silver, and that gold is therefore likely 
to outperform silver. When looking at relative forecasts, one can forecast 
the behavior of smaller clusters (e.g., pairs) or larger clusters (e.g., sectors). 
Smaller clusters have the advantage of being easier to understand and ana-
lyze. In particular, pairs are primarily attractive because, in theory, one can 
carefully select instruments that are directly comparable.
However, pairs have several comparative disadvantages. Very few assets 
can actually be compared so precisely and directly with one other instru-
ment, rendering a major benefit of pairs trading impracticable. Two Internet 
companies might each depend significantly on revenues from their respec-
tive search engines, but they may differ along other lines. One could have 
more of a content‐driven business while the other uses advertising to sup-
plement the search engine revenues. Meanwhile, one could find other com-
panies with strong advertising or content businesses, each of which shares 
some characteristics and sector‐effects with the first pair. Here the trader is 
presented with a dilemma: Which pairs are actually the best to use? Or to 
put it another way, how should the trader’s pairs best be structured?
Another approach is to make relative bets within larger clusters or 
groups. Researchers group securities together primarily in an effort to isolate 
and eliminate common effects among the group. A large part of the point of 
grouping stocks within their market sector, for example, is to eliminate the 
impact of a general movement of the sector and thereby focus on the relative 
movement of stocks within the sector. It turns out to be extremely difficult 
to isolate group effects with a group size of merely two. On the other hand, 
larger clusters allow for a cleaner distinction between group behavior and 
idiosyncratic behavior, which is beneficial for many quant strategies. As a re-
sult, most quants who trade in groups tend to use larger groups than simply 
pairs when they make relative bets.

## Page 70

50  Ins I de the Black Box
Researchers also must choose how they create these clusters, either us-
ing statistical techniques or using heuristics (e.g., fundamentally defined in-
dustry groups). There are many statistical techniques aimed at discerning 
when things are similar to each other or when they belong together as a 
group. However, statistical models can be fooled by the data, leading to bad 
groupings. For example, there may be periods during which the prices of 
Internet stocks behave like the price of corn. This may cause the statistical 
model to group them together, but Internet stocks and corn are ultimately 
more different than they are similar, and most fundamental grouping ap-
proaches would never put them together. Furthermore, any time that the 
market regime changes, the relationships among instruments frequently also 
change, which can lead the system to mistakenly group things together, even 
though they no longer will behave like each other.
Alternatively, groups can be defined heuristically. Asset classes, sectors, 
and industries are common examples of heuristically defined groups. They 
have the advantage of making sense and being defensible theoretically, but 
they are also imprecise (for instance, to what industry does a conglomer -
ate such as General Electric belong?) and possibly too rigid. Rigidity in 
particular can be a problem because over time, similarities among instru-
ments change. Sometimes stocks and bonds move in opposite directions, 
and sometimes they move in the same direction. Because the correlation 
between these two asset classes moves in phases, it can be very tricky to 
analyze the relationship theoretically and make a static, unchanging decla-
ration that they belong in the same group or in different groups. As a result, 
most grouping techniques (and by extension, most strategies that are based 
on relative forecasts), whether statistically driven or heuristic, suffer from 
changes in market regime that cause drastic changes in the relationships 
among instruments.
In evaluating alpha‐oriented strategies, this distinction among bet struc-
tures, most notably between directional (single security) bets versus relative 
(multisecurity) bets, is rather important. The behavior of a given type of 
alpha model is very different if it is implemented on an instrument by itself 
than it would be if implemented on a group of instruments relative to each 
other. It is critical to balance the risks and benefits of the various approaches 
to grouping. In general, relative alpha strategies tend to exhibit smoother 
returns during normal times than intrinsic alpha strategies, but they can also 
experience unique problems related to incorrect groupings during stress-
ful periods. Some quants attempt to mitigate the problems associated with 
any particular grouping technique by utilizing several grouping techniques 
in concert. For example, one could first group stocks by their sectors but 
then refine these groupings using a more dynamic statistical approach that 
reflects recent correlations among the stocks.

Also, it is worth clarifying one piece of particularly unhelpful, but 
widely used, hedge fund industry jargon: relative value. This term refers to 
strategies that utilize a relative bet structure, but the value part of the term 
is actually not useful. Certainly strategies that make forecasts based on a 
notion of the relative valuation of instruments are quite common. How-
ever, most strategies called relative value have little to do with value invest-
ing. Relative mean reversion strategies, relative momentum strategies, and 
other kinds of relative fundamental strategies are all commonly referred to 
as relative value.
Investment Universe
A given strategy can be implemented in a variety of instruments, and the 
quant must choose which ones to include or exclude. The first signifi-
cant choice a quant makes about the investment universe is geography. A 
short‐term relative mean reversion strategy traded on stocks in the United 
States might not behave similarly to the same strategy applied to stocks in 
Hong Kong. The researcher must decide where to apply the strategy. The 
second significant choice a quant makes about the investment universe re-
lates to its asset class. A growth strategy applied to foreign exchange mar -
kets might behave differently than one applied to equity indices. The quant 
must decide what asset classes to trade with each strategy. A third signifi-
cant choice a quant must make about the investment universe relates to the 
instrument class. Equity indices, as accessed through the futures markets, 
behave differently than single stocks, even though both belong to the eq-
uity asset class. Also, the liquidity characteristics and nature of the other 
participants in a given market differ from one instrument class to another, 
and these are some of the considerations quants must make regarding what 
kinds of instruments to trade. There are also tax implications to consider. 
Finally, in some cases, quants may include or exclude specific groups of in-
struments for a variety of reasons.
The choice of an investment universe is dependent on several strong 
preferences that quants tend to have. First, the quant generally prefers li-
quidity in the underlying instruments so that estimations of transaction 
costs are reliable. Second, quants generally require large quantities of high‐
quality data. In general, such data can be found in highly liquid and devel-
oped markets. Third, quants tend to prefer instruments that behave in a 
manner conducive to being predicted by systematic models. Returning to 
the example of biotechnology stocks, some quants exclude them because 
they are subject to sudden, violent price changes based on events such as 
government approval or rejection of their latest drug. Although physicians 
with a biotech specialization may have some intuitions on this subject, it’s 

## Page 72

52  Ins I de the Black Box
simply not something that most quants can model. As a result of these pref-
erences, the most typical asset classes and instruments in which one can find 
quants participating are common stocks, futures (especially on bonds and 
equity indices), and foreign exchange markets. Some strategies might trade 
the fixed‐income asset class using instruments other than futures (e.g., swaps 
or cash bonds), though these are significantly less common today than they 
were in the middle or late 1990s. Geographically, the bulk of quant trad-
ing occurs in the United States, developed Europe, and Japan, with lesser 
amounts done in other parts of North America and developed Asia. Quants 
are almost completely absent from illiquid instruments, or those traded over 
the counter (OTC), such as corporate or convertible bonds, and are less (but 
increasingly) common in emerging markets.
This last fact may change going forward as OTC markets become bet-
ter regulated and electronic. But that also implies that the liquidity of these 
markets will improve. As such, this notion of liquidity is perhaps the sim-
plest way to summarize in one dimension the salient characteristics of the 
trading universe for a strategy. After all, more liquid instruments also tend 
to offer more high‐quality data and to be more conducive to being forecast, 
on average.
Model d efinition
An idea for a trading strategy, its core concept, is insufficient for use as 
a trading strategy: The quant must specifically define every aspect of the 
strategy before it is usable. Furthermore, any differences in the way a quant 
chooses to specify or define an idea for her strategy might lead it to behave 
quite differently from the way other choices would have. For example, there 
could be multiple ways to define a trend. Some simply compute the total 
return of an instrument over some historical period, and if that number is 
positive, a positive trend is identified (a negative return would constitute a 
negative trend). Other trend traders use moving average approaches, such 
as the ones illustrated in Exhibits 3.1, 3.3, and 3.4, to look for prices to 
rise above or below recent average prices and so determine the presence of 
a trend. Still other trend strategies seek to identify the breakout of the very 
early stages of a trend, found using specific price patterns they believe are 
present in this critical phase, but they do not attempt to determine whether 
a long‐term trend is actually in place or not.
These are but a few of the more common ways a trend can be defined. 
Just so, each kind of alpha strategy can be defined in various ways, and it 
is a significant part of the quant’s job to decide precisely how to specify 
the strategy mathematically. This is an area for an investor in quant trad-
ing to study carefully because it is often a source of differentiation—and 

## Page 73

 potentially of comparative advantage—for a quant. In the “Time Horizon” 
section of this chapter, we saw that even a specification about the time hori-
zon of a strategy for timing the stock market can have a dramatic impact on 
whether it is long or short at a given point in time. Given the importance of 
time horizon, it is easy to understand the impact of using an entirely differ-
ent definition of the strategy on its behavior. However, it may be challenging 
to get a quant to share with an outsider details on exactly how his model is 
specified. For the nonquant, then, model specification may remain a more 
opaque aspect of the black box, but exploring this idea as much as possible 
with a quant trader could, in fact, highlight the reasons for differences in 
performance that are observed versus the quant’s peer group.
One especially important type of specification is in the form of setting 
parameters for a model. Returning to our trend example, the number of 
days in each moving average (e.g., a 5‐/10‐day moving average crossover 
strategy versus a 5‐/20‐day moving average crossover strategy) is a param-
eter. The specification of parameters is also an area in which some quants 
utilize machine learning or data‐mining techniques. In the section “Data‐
Driven Alpha Models,” we mentioned the idea of fitting models to the data 
and setting parameter values. This is a problem to which machine learning 
techniques, which I described earlier as being neither easily nor commonly 
applied to the problem of finding alpha, are better suited and more widely 
used. In essence, machine learning techniques are applied to determine the 
optimal set of specifications for a quant model. Machine learning algorithms 
are designed to provide an intelligent and scientifically valid way of testing 
many potential sets of specifications without overfitting.
A subset of the problem of determining parameters relates to how of-
ten the models themselves are adjusted for more recent data. This process 
is known as refitting because some of the same work that goes on in the 
original research process is repeated in live trading in an attempt to refresh 
the model and make it as adaptive as possible to current market conditions. 
Because this can be a computationally intensive process, sometimes involv-
ing millions or even billions of calculations, many quants refit their models 
infrequently or not at all. Refitting also leads to a greater risk of overfitting, 
a very treacherous problem indeed, since spurious and fleeting relationships 
may be mistaken for valid, lasting ones.
Conditioning v ariables
Many strategists (those whose job is to create trading strategies) employ 
conditioning variables to their strategies. These make the strategies more 
complex, but they also may increase the efficacy of the forecasts gener -
ated. There are two basic types of conditioning variables. One kind is a 

## Page 74

54  Ins I de the Black Box
modifying conditioner , which takes a given signal and changes whether 
or how it is used, generally based on characteristics of the signal itself or 
its results. For example, a strategist may find that utilizing a simple trend 
indicator, for example, is not a sufficiently interesting strategy to pursue. 
After all, there are many false starts to worry about with a trend‐follow -
ing strategy, and many experienced practitioners will admit that, without 
the “money management” or “risk management” rules they employ, their 
strategies would be basically uninvestable. These rules, and others to be 
discussed, can properly be thought of as conditioning variables for the 
trend‐following strategy.
For example, a stop‐loss is a common conditioning variable to pair with 
a trend‐following strategy. The idea would be to follow the trend, unless 
that trend has been reversing and causing losses to the position sufficient 
to trigger a stop‐loss. There are numerous kinds of stops: stop‐losses, 
profit‐targets (or profit‐stops), and time stops. Stop‐losses have already been 
described, and are generally employed when strategies have many “false” 
signals, but where the “good” signals can yield significant profits. Just so, 
most directional trend‐following strategies make money on a minority of 
their trades (often less than 40 percent of them!), but the gain on their 
winners is substantially larger than the losses on their losers (because of 
stop‐loss techniques).
Profit‐targets are utilized when the strategist believes that the position 
gets riskier as it generates profits. This is a reasonable enough concept: Mar-
kets rarely go in the same direction indefinitely, so it may make sense to take 
profits if they’ve been going the same way long enough for the strategy to 
generate significant profits. Finally, time‐stops are utilized to avoid the prob-
lem of holding positions on the basis of signals that may have been triggered 
far enough in the past as to be considered stale. It’s a way of enforcing a 
refreshing of the bets being taken in the portfolio, among other things.
A second type of conditioning variable is a secondary conditioner, which 
requires the agreement (or some other set of conditions) across multiple 
types of signals to trigger a tradable forecast. For example, a large portion 
of fundamental equity analysts are “GARP” devotees, meaning they believe 
in owning “Growth at a Reasonable Price.” If a company is identified as 
being both growing and inexpensive, it is a candidate to buy. Cheapness on 
its own would not justify a purchase, just as growth on its own would not. 
In price‐driven strategies, sometimes trend at various timescales, or trend 
and mean reversion, are combined. For example, a mean reversion strategy 
could be conditioned to buy instruments that have experienced price de-
clines, but only when that causes the resulting position to be in the direction 
of the longer‐term trend (i.e., this strategy would buy dips in up‐trending 
markets, or short sell run‐ups in down‐trending markets).

## Page 75

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  55
Utilizing conditioning variables is how most rule‐based pattern recognition 
strategies are designed. Like data‐driven strategies, they are looking for repeated 
patterns in market behavior (basically, more complex patterns than “buy win-
ners/sell losers” or “buy dips/sell run‐ups”), but theory‐driven pattern‐recogni-
tion models will begin with predefined rules. Data‐driven traders rely on their 
algorithms to determine what a “pattern” is in the first place (though, again, 
within the bounds specified, as discussed in “Data‐Driven Alpha Models”).
r un f requency
A final component of building a given alpha model is determining the run 
frequency, or the frequency with which the model is actually run to seek 
new trading ideas. Some quants run their models relatively infrequently—for 
example, once per month. At the other extreme, some run their models more 
or less continuously, in real time. Quants must manage an interesting trade-
off here. Specifically, increasing the frequency of model runs usually leads 
to a greater number of transactions, which means more commissions paid 
to brokers and higher transaction costs. Also, more frequent model runs 
lead to a greater probability that the model is moving the portfolio around 
based on noisy data that don’t actually contain much meaning. This, in turn, 
would mean that the increased transaction costs would cause little or no 
incremental improvement in the alpha generated by the strategy and would 
thereby reduce its overall profitability.
On the other hand, less frequent model runs lead to a smaller number of 
larger‐sized trades. These are expensive in a different way, namely in terms 
of the impact these trades can have on the marketplace. If models are run 
too infrequently, then at those times when they are run they could recom-
mend making very significant changes to the currently held portfolio. This 
would mean transacting larger blocks of trades, which would likely cost 
more in terms of moving the market. Less frequent model runs are also 
prone to problems associated with the moment of observation of markets. 
If a strategy is run once a month, it could miss opportunities to trade at 
more favorable prices that occur during the month while the model is dor -
mant. Alternatively, the model may attempt in vain to trade at attractive, 
but quickly fleeting, prices that occur if there has been some aberration just 
around the time of the model being run.
Whether more frequent or less frequent model runs are better depends 
on many other aspects of the strategy, most especially the time horizon of 
the forecast and the kinds of inputs. In the end, most quants run their mod-
els no less than once a week, and many run continuously throughout the 
day. The slower‐moving the strategy, obviously, the more leeway there is, 
whereas shorter‐term strategies tend toward continuous, real‐time runs.

We have described a few of the kinds of important decisions that quants 
must make in building a given alpha model. To succeed in quant trading, 
each of these decisions requires good judgment on the part of the quant. In 
short, successful quants are characterized in part by an incredible attention 
to detail and tirelessness in seeking the right questions to ask and the best 
solutions to address them. Nevertheless, for those who do not build quant 
trading systems but who are interested in understanding them, the kinds of 
issues discussed in this section are straightforward to understand and pro-
vide a useful way to distinguish one quant from another.
A final, important implication of these details of implementation is that 
they lead to an explosion in the variety of quant trading strategies that actu-
ally exist. You can easily see that the number of permutations of a strategy 
focused on the concept of value, for example, is enormous when accounting 
for differences in the type, time horizon, bet structure, investable universe, 
model definition, conditioning variables, and frequency of model run. Just 
taking the first four types of implementation details listed here and using 
the simplifying categories we described in this section, there are two types 
of forecasts (direction and magnitude), four types of time horizon (high 
frequency, short term, medium term, and long term), two types of bet struc-
tures (intrinsic and relative), and four asset classes (stocks, bonds, curren-
cies, and commodities). Therefore one could build 64 different value models 
(2 × 4 × 2 × 4 = 64 permutations), and this excludes the question of how 
many ways one can define the idea of value, how one could condition the 
use of value on other variables, and how often one can look for value. This 
diversity might seem daunting at first glance, but the framework established 
here can help anyone interested in understanding what’s inside a black box. 
Exhibit 3.7 revisits the taxonomy of alpha models, expanding it to include 
the implementation approaches discussed here.

Each of the decisions a quant makes in defining a trading strategy is an im-
portant driver of its behavior. But there is another extremely important set 
of choices the quant must make in constructing a trading strategy. Specifi-
cally, the quant is not limited to choosing just one approach to a given alpha 
model. Instead, he is equally free to choose to employ multiple types of 
alpha models. The method used to combine these alpha models is an arena 
rich with possibilities. The most sophisticated and successful quants tend to 
utilize several kinds of alpha strategies, including trend and reversion, and

various kinds of fundamental approaches across a variety of time horizons, 
trade structures, instruments, and geographies. Such quants benefit from 
alpha diversification in exactly the same way that diversification is helpful in 
so many other aspects of financial life.
Blending or mixing alpha signals has many analogues in discretionary 
trading (and decision making) in general. Imagine a mutual fund portfolio 
manager who has two analysts covering XOM. One analyst, focused on 
fundamental value in the classic Graham and Dodd sense, expects XOM to 
rise by 50 percent over the next year. The other analyst, taking a momentum 
approach, thinks XOM is likely to be flat over the next year. What is the net 
expectation the portfolio manager should have of the price of XOM, given

the two analysts’ predictions? This is the core problem that is addressed by 
blending alpha models, each of which can be likened to an analyst.
The three most common quant approaches to blending forecasts are 
via linear models, nonlinear models, and machine learning models. A sig -
nificant fourth school of thought believes that alpha models should not 
be combined at all. Instead, several portfolios are constructed, each based 
on the output from a given alpha model. These factor portfolios are then 
combined using any of the portfolio construction techniques discussed in 
Chapter 7.
Each of these four approaches to signal mixing has its disciples, and as 
with most everything else we’ve discussed, the best way to blend alphas de-
pends on the model. In general, as in the case of an alpha model, the purpose 
of a method of mixing alpha models is to find the combination of them that 
best predicts the future. All other things being equal, it is very likely that any 
reasonably intelligent combination of alphas will do a better job together 
than any one of them could do individually over time. Consider Exhibit 3.8. 
Here we can see that Forecasts A and B each occasionally predict future 
events correctly. This is illustrated in that there is some overlap between 
Forecast A and the actual outcome and between Forecast B and the actual 
outcome. But each forecast has only a small amount of success in predicting 
the future. However, together, Forecasts A and B are about twice as likely to 
be correct about the future outcomes as either is separately.
Linear models are by far the most common way in which quants com-
bine alpha factors to construct a composite forecast. A linear model is a rea-
sonable facsimile for one of the more common ways that humans normally 
think about cause‐and‐effect relationships. In linear models, the inclusion of 
one factor is independent of the inclusion of other factors, and each factor 
is expected to be additive, independently of the other factors that might be

included or excluded. For example, for a high school student trying to get 
into a good university, she can think of her grades, standardized test scores, 
extracurricular activities, recommendations, and essays as being these inde-
pendent factors in the linear model that predicts her odds of gaining admis-
sion. Regardless of the other factors, grades are always important, as is each 
other factor. As such, a linear model is relevant. If, on the other hand, it was 
the case that, with high enough test scores, her essays wouldn’t matter, a 
linear model is no longer the correct way to predict her chances of getting in.
The first step in using a linear model in this way is to assign a weight 
to each alpha factor. To return to our example, if we were trying to pre-
dict university admissions, this step would require us to define the relative 
importance of grades versus, say, test scores. This is typically done using a 
technique known as multiple regression, which is aimed at finding the com-
bination of alpha factors that explains the maximum amount of the histori-
cal behavior of the instruments being traded. The presumption is that, if a 
model reasonably explains the past, it has a reasonable chance of explaining 
the future well enough to make a profit. These weights are then applied to 
the outputs of their respective alpha factors, which are usually a forecast or 
score of some kind. The weighted sum of these multiple forecasts gives us a 
combined forecast. Or, to be more specific, by summing the products of the 
weights of each factor and the outputs of each factor, we arrive at a com-
posite forecast or score. This composite can then be used to help determine 
the target portfolio.
Imagine a trading system with two alpha factors. One of the alpha fac-
tors focuses on E/P ratios (and is therefore a yield model), and the other 
focuses on price trends (and is therefore a trend model). The yield factor 
forecasts a return of +20 percent over the next 12 months for XOM, where-
as the trend factor forecasts a return of –10 percent for XOM over the 
next 12 months. Based on a historical regression, the models are weighted  
70 percent toward the yield factor and 30 percent toward the trend factor. 
Taking their scores and weights together, the total 12‐month return forecast 
of our two‐factor model is computed as follows:
70% weight × 20% return forecast for the yield factor comes to +14%.
30% weight × -10% return forecast for the trend factor comes to -3%.
The sum of these two products comes to +11 percent, which is the total 
expected 12‐month return for XOM using the example above.
A special case of linear models is the equal‐weighted model. Though not 
highly quantitative, equal‐weighting methods abound among quant traders. 
The general idea behind equal weighting is that the trader has no confidence 

## Page 80

in his ability to define more accurate weights and therefore decides to give 
all the alpha factors equal importance. A variant of this approach gives each 
factor an “equal risk” weighting, which incorporates the concept that giving 
a dollar to a highly risky strategy is not the same as giving a dollar to a less 
risky strategy. In Chapter 6, we cover both these approaches in more detail 
as they apply to portfolio construction. Still another approach would be to 
give each factor its own weight discretionarily.
There are many forms of nonlinear models that can be used to combine 
alpha factors with each other. In contrast to linear models, nonlinear models 
are based on the premise that the relationship between the variables used to 
make forecasts either is not independent (i.e., each variable is not expected 
to add value independently of the others) or else the relationship changes 
over time. As such, the two main types of nonlinear models are conditional 
models and rotation models. Conditional models base the weight of one 
alpha factor on the reading of another factor.
Using the same two factors as earlier, a conditional model might indi-
cate that E/P yields should drive forecasts, but only when the price trends 
are in agreement with the E/P yields. In other words, the highest‐yielding 
stocks would be candidates to be bought only if the price trends of these 
stocks were also positive. The lowest‐yielding stocks would be candidates to 
be sold short, but only if the price trends of these stocks were also negative. 
When the agreement condition is met, the yield factor entirely drives the 
forecast. But if the price trend doesn’t confirm the E/P yield signal, the yield 
signal is ignored entirely.
Revisiting the linear factor combination demonstrated earlier, our con-
ditional model would generate no signal for XOM because the price trend 
forecast a negative return, whereas the yield factor forecast a positive return. 
If, instead, XOM had a positive return forecast from the trend factor, the 
combined nonlinear model would have a targeted return of +20 percent 
over the next 12 months for that stock because this is the return expected by 
the value factor, which now has been “activated” by its agreement with the 
trend factor. Note that mixing models in this way is similar to utilizing more 
conditioning variables in the specification of an alpha model (discussed in 
“Conditioning Variables”), though it is not required that the conditional 
linear model be an “all or none” type of approach. It is possible to utilize 
a conditioning variable that simply increases or decreases the weight of a 
given factor based on the values of other factors at that point in time. An 
example of a conditional model is shown in Exhibit 3.9.
Another type of conditional model for assigning weights to various 
forecasts is to consider variables external to those forecasts as the drivers 
of weights. For example, some practitioners believe that stat arb strategies 
perform better when market volatility is at elevated levels, and when stocks’ 

## Page 81

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  61
correlations to each other are at relatively low levels. Thus, a firm trading both 
mean reversion stat arb and directional trend strategies might overweight the 
stat arb component when volatility is high and correlations are low. When the 
opposite is true in both cases, perhaps they overweight the trend strategies. 
And at other times, perhaps they equally weight both strategies.
The second nonlinear way to blend alphas uses a rotation approach. 
Rather than following trends in markets themselves, this type of model fol-
lows trends in the performance of the alpha models. These are similar to 
linear models except that the weights of factors fluctuate over time based 
on updated calculations of the various signals’ weights. As time passes, the 
more recent data are used to determine weighting schemes in the hope that 
the model’s weights are more relevant to current market conditions. This 
method usually results in giving higher weights to the factors that have per-
formed better recently. As such, this is a form of trend following in the tim-
ing of alpha factors.
Machine learning models are also sometimes used by quants to deter -
mine the optimal weights of various alpha factors. As in the case of de-
termining optimal parameters, machine learning techniques applied to the 
mixing of alpha factors are both more common and more successful than 
machine learning approaches used to forecast markets themselves. These 
techniques algorithmically determine the mix of alpha factors that best ex-
plains the past, with the presumption that a good mix in the past is likely to 
be a good mix in the future. As in the case of rotational models, many ma-
chine learning approaches to mixing alpha factors periodically update the 
optimal weights based on the ever‐changing and ever‐growing set of data 
available. Unlike the example of using machine learning for the generation 
of actual alpha signals, applying machine learning to determine the weights 
of various alpha forecasts is more common and significantly more success-
ful. Nevertheless, machine learning remains less widely used than the other 
techniques for blending alphas described here, and only a relatively small 
proportion of the universe of quant traders employs these methods.
We have briefly summarized common approaches to mixing signals, or 
combining alpha forecasts. This is a part of the quant trading process that 
has received precious little attention in the academic literature and trade

press, but personally I find it one of the most fascinating questions about 
quant trading—or any trading. It is exactly the same problem any decision 
maker faces when looking at a variety of sources of information and opin-
ions: What is the best way to synthesize all available and relevant informa-
tion into a sensible decision?
It is worth noting that signal mixing shares some similarities with portfo-
lio construction. Both are questions of sizing and combining, after all. How-
ever, they are mostly distinct and separate processes. Signal‐mixing models 
size multiple alpha signals to arrive at one composite forecast per instrument, 
which is then used in portfolio construction. Portfolio construction models 
take multiple kinds of signals as inputs, including alpha signals, risk models, 
and transaction cost models (which we cover in the next two chapters), and 
attempt to size individual positions correctly, given these inputs.

In his excellent book The Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver presents a some-
what different—though complementary and related—type of distinction be-
tween approaches to forecasting.7 Rather than being a distinction based on 
the type of science one performs, as laid out in this chapter, it is a distinction 
based on the branch of statistics to which one subscribes.
One major branch of statistics, now popularly known as Bayesian sta-
tistics (after Thomas Bayes), placed a strong emphasis on the role of a “pri-
or” in forecasting. A prior in this case refers to a belief held by the forecaster. 
For example, imagine that you have heard your spouse (with whom your 
relationship is generally good) make what seems like an insulting statement 
in reference to you. But what is the probability that this statement was, in 
fact, an insult? Bayes would advise that you begin your analysis of this state-
ment by considering what the chances are that your spouse would insult 
you, before you heard this particular comment. Those odds are probably 
low, in particular if the relationship is fine to begin with. Let’s say that this 
probability is 10 percent. Next, we would be advised to account for the 
probability that the statement we heard was not insulting, given that your 
partner is unlikely to insult you. If the statement sounded really negative 
(for example, “my husband is an idiot”), this, too, might be unlikely. Let’s 
place these odds also at 10 percent. Finally, one should account for the pos-
sibility that you heard your partner make this statement because she is, in 
fact, insulting you. If she thought you weren’t within earshot, perhaps the 
odds are higher. If she sees you directly in front of her, the odds are naturally 
expected to be lower. For this example, let’s assume that your partner thinks 

## Page 83

Alpha Models: How Quants Make Money  63
you are not home. This makes the odds that this statement was uttered by 
your partner as an insult, say, 65 percent.
Accounting for all of this information, Bayes’ Theorem would tell you 
that the odds you were in fact insulted, given your priors, are just under 
42 percent.8 This is a pleasingly intuitive result: Your dear spouse is not ex-
pected to insult you. However, her statement was quite negative, and it was 
made in a context that increases one’s suspicion of it being meant badly. The 
resulting odds are lower than they would have been without the prior that 
your partner is unlikely to insult you to begin with, but much higher than if 
you hadn’t heard this statement under dubious circumstances.
Readers may note the philosophical kinship between a prior and a the-
ory. This is more than a coincidence: The two concepts are closely related. 
The basic idea behind Bayesian forecasting methods is to allow new infor -
mation to change a prior. The more that this new information is surprising 
(i.e., in conflict with the prior), the more we move away from our prior.
Another major branch of statistics is known as frequentist statistics. 
Frequentist statistics calls for the data to inform us about probabilities and 
confidence intervals around those probabilities. For example, if the data in-
dicate that a stock that has an Earnings‐to‐Price ratio of 0.03 or lower (i.e., 
a P/E ratio of 33.33 or higher, or which is negative) has historically declined 
by 10 percent, with a confidence interval of six percent over the 12 months 
after this ratio was observed, then you have what you need for your forecast 
of any specific stock.
Again, there is a philosophical link between this idea and the data‐driven 
approach described in this chapter. Furthermore, there is even a similarity 
in the ways in which these distinctions can be shown to be imperfect. Many 
theory‐driven scientists are big believers in looking at the data, and in allow-
ing the data to drive decisions such as parameter values in a model. Just so, 
many self‐described Bayesians can be found using frequentist techniques. In 
fact, in his fascinating review of Silver’s book, Larry Wasserman of Carn-
egie Mellon University makes the point that Silver himself relies heavily on 
frequentist approaches to ascertaining the efficacy of a model—so much so 
that Wasserman calls Silver a frequentist.

Having made so many decisions about what approach to forecasting 
one should utilize, what sort of alpha should be pursued, how to specify 
and implement it, and how to combine this alpha with others, the quant is 
left with an output. The output is typically either a return forecast (expected 
return = X percent) or a directional forecast (expected direction = up, down, 
or flat). Sometimes quants add elements of time (expected return over the 
next Y days) and/or probability (Z percent likelihood of expected return) 
to help utilize the output effectively in trading decisions. See Exhibit 3.10

for a recap of the structure of a quant trading system. As we continue our 
progress through the black box, we will highlight the components discussed.
I am consistently amazed by the juxtaposition of the simplicity and rela-
tively small number of concepts used to manage money quantitatively and 
the incredible diversity of quant trading strategies as applied in the real 
world. The decisions quants make in the areas discussed in this chapter are 
major sources of the significant differences in the returns of traders who 
may be pursuing the same sources of alpha. Those evaluating quant trad-
ers (or quants who are evaluating trading strategies of their own) can use 
the framework provided in this chapter to help determine the nature of the 
strategies being traded. We now turn our attention to risk modeling, another 
key component of a quant trading strategy.

The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain

r
isk management should not be thought of solely as the avoidance of risk 
or reduction of loss. It is about the intentional selection and sizing of 
exposures to improve the quality and consistency of returns. In Chapter 3, 
we defined alpha as a type of exposure from which a quant trader expects 
to profit. But we also noted that, from time to time, there can be a downside 
to accepting this exposure. This is not what we classify as risk per se. By 
pursuing a specific kind of alpha, we are explicitly saying that we want to be 
invested in the ups and downs of that exposure because we believe we will 
profit from it in the long run. Though it would be great fun to accept only 
the upside of a given alpha strategy and reject the losses that can be associ-
ated with it, sadly, that is not possible. However , there are other exposures 
that are frequently linked to the pursuit of some kind of alpha. These other 
exposures are not expected to make us any money, but they frequently ac-
company the return‐driving exposure. These exposures are risks.
Risk exposures generally will not produce profits over the long haul, 
but they can impact the returns of a strategy day to day. More important 
still, the quant is not attempting to forecast these exposures, usually because 
he cannot do so successfully. But the fact remains that one of the great 
strengths of quant trading is to be able to measure various exposures and to 
be intentional about the selection of such exposures. This chapter deals with 
how quants define, measure, and control risks.
Imagine a relative alpha strategy that focuses on the value (yield) of var-
ious stocks, buying higher‐yielding stocks and selling short lower‐yielding 
stocks. This strategy clearly can lose money if “cheap” (higher‐yield) stocks 

## Page 88

68  Ins I de the Black Box
underperform “expensive” (lower‐yield) stocks, according to whatever defi-
nition the quant chooses for “cheapness” (or yield). That risk is inherent to 
the pursuit of a value strategy, even if the quant has reason to believe that 
value strategies should make money in the long term. However , a value 
strategy without further specification can end up taking significant sector 
bets in addition to the intentional bet on value. After all, it’s easy to see that 
stocks within a sector tend to move together . So if one technology stock 
has gotten very cheap, there’s a reasonable chance that many other tech-
nology stocks have also gotten cheap. This means that an unconstrained 
value‐hunting strategy is likely to end up with a net long position in the 
technology sector (in this example). But there is no evidence that there exists 
a long‐term benefit of overweighting one industry or sector versus another .
More important, assume that the strategy has neither the intention nor 
the capability to forecast the performance of various sectors. Therefore, sec-
tor exposure would be considered a form of risk in our framework, because 
sector performance is not being intentionally forecast, but having net expo-
sure to various sectors can alter the strategy’s results day to day. So the key 
to understanding risk exposures as they relate to quant trading strategies 
is that risk exposures are those that are not intentionally sought out by the 
nature of whatever forecast the quant is making in the alpha model.
If alpha models are like optimists, risk models are like pessimists. Risk 
models exist largely to control the size of desirable exposures or to deal with 
undesirable types of exposures. Their job is to raise hell about things that 
can cause losses or uncertainty, particularly those bets that are unintention-
ally made or are incidental byproducts of the alpha model. Risk models both 
highlight and attempt to remove undesirable exposures from a portfolio.
There are, however , only a few things you can do with a given type 
of exposure, aside from simply accepting it outright. Mostly you can limit 
its size or eliminate it altogether . The function of risk management in the 
investment process is to determine which of these courses of action is most 
prudent for each kind of exposure and to provide that input to the port -
folio construction model. In general, risk models reduce the amount of 
money a quant can make, but this is a trade-off many quants are willing to 
accept. Managing risk has the day‐to‐day benefit of reducing the volatil -
ity of a strategy’s returns. But it also has the far more important benefit 
of reducing the likelihood of large losses. In many ways, the failures of 
investment managers, in general (quant or not), are usually precipitated 
by failures to manage risk. This can be seen with Long‐Term Capital Man -
agement (LTCM) in 1998, with Amaranth in 2006, with U.S. quant equity 
traders in August 2007, and with a great many investors in the fall (no pun 
intended) of 2008.

Size limiting is an important form of risk management. It is easy to imag-
ine having a tremendously good trading idea, seemingly a sure thing, but 
without some sense of risk management, there can be a temptation to put 
all one’s capital into this single trade. This is almost always a bad idea. 
Why? Because, empirically, a sure thing rarely exists, so the correct way to 
size a trade in general is certainly not to put all your chips on it. Otherwise 
it is likely that in the process of going all in, at some point the trader will 
go bankrupt. In other words, it is prudent to take just as much exposure 
to a trade as is warranted by the considerations of the opportunity (alpha) 
and the downside (risk). Quantitative risk models that are focused on limit-
ing the size of bets are common, and many are quite simple. The following 
sections explain how they work.
There are several kinds of quantitative risk models that limit size, and 
they vary in three primary ways:
	 1.	 The manner in which size is limited.
	 2.	 How risk is measured.
	 3.	 What is having its size limited.
Limiting by Constraint or p enalty
Approaches to the size limits come in two main forms: hard constraints 
and penalties. Hard constraints are set to draw a line in terms of risk. For 
instance, imagine a position limit that dictates that no position will be larger 
than 3 percent of the portfolio, no matter how strong the signal. However , 
this hard limit may be somewhat arbitrary (e.g., imagine a 3.00 percent po-
sition size limit; why is a 3.01 percent position so much worse?), so quants 
sometimes build penalty functions that allow a position to increase beyond 
the limit level, but only if the alpha model expects a significantly larger 
return (i.e., a much larger expected return than was required to allow the 
position merely to reach the limit size in the first place). The penalty func-
tions work so that the further past the limit level we go, the more difficult 
it becomes to increase the position size additionally. So, using our example, 
it would be far easier to see a 3.01 percent position than to see a 6 percent 
position, because the latter is further from the limit than the former .
In this way, the model attempts to address the idea that an opportunity 
can sometimes be so good as to warrant an exception to the rule. In a sense, 
penalty functions for size limits can be thought of as making rules to govern 
exceptions.

## Page 90

70  Ins I de the Black Box
The levels of limits and/or penalties can be determined in the same 
ways as most other things in the quant world, namely either from theory 
or from the data (the latter via data‐mining approaches). Theory‐driven 
approaches mostly look like an arbitrary level that is set, tested, and, if 
needed, adjusted until it produces an acceptable outcome. So, to return 
to the earlier example of a 3 percent limit on position sizes, the quant 
researcher could have started with a risk limit of 5 percent because his 
experience seemed to dictate that this was a reasonable level to choose. 
But through testing and simulating the historical results of this strategy, he 
could have come to realize that a far more appropriate level is 3 percent, 
which better balances the ability to make sizeable bets when attractive op -
portunities appear against the necessity of recognizing that any given trade 
could easily go wrong. Data‐driven approaches are more varied and can 
include machine learning techniques to test many combinations of limits 
or simply testing various limit levels and letting the historical data empiri -
cally determine the final outcome. Either way, these levels and the severity 
of any penalty functions are parameters of the risk model that the quant 
must set, based on either research or heuristics.
Measuring the a mount of r isk
There are two generally accepted ways of measuring the amount of risk 
in the marketplace. The first is longitudinal and measures risk by comput-
ing the standard deviation of the returns of various instruments over time, 
which is a way of getting at the concept of uncertainty. In finance circles, this 
concept is usually referred to as volatility. The more volatility, the more risk 
is said to be present in the markets.
1
The second way to measure risk is to measure the level of similarity in 
the behavior of the various instruments within a given investment universe. 
This is frequently calculated by taking the cross‐sectional standard deviation 
of all the relevant instruments for a given period. The larger the standard 
deviation, the more varied the underlying instruments are behaving. This 
means that the market is less risky because the portfolio can be made of a 
larger number of diversified bets. This can be seen easily at the extreme: If all 
the instruments in a portfolio are perfectly correlated, then as one bet goes, 
so go all the other bets. This concept is known among quants as dispersion. 
Dispersion can also be measured by the correlation or covariance among 
the instruments in a given universe. Here, too, the more similarly the instru-
ments are behaving, the more risky the market is said to be.
There are many other , less commonly utilized, approaches to measur -
ing risk as well. These include the use of measures such as credit spreads or 
credit default swaps (CDSs), or the use of implied volatilities.

Risk Models  71
Where Limits Can Be 
a
pplied
Size‐limiting models such as these can be used to govern many kinds of 
exposures. One can limit the size of single positions and/or groups of posi-
tions, such as sectors or asset classes. Alternatively, one can limit the size of 
exposure to various types of risks. For example, in equity trading, one can 
limit the exposure of a model to market bets (such as a +/–5 percent net 
exposure limit) or to market capitalization bets. In general, risks that are 
subjected to limits or penalties are those that are not being forecast explic-
itly by the alpha model. If an alpha model attempts to forecast individual 
stocks but makes no attempt to forecast the stock market as a whole, it may 
be prudent to constrain the size of the bet that the portfolio can ultimately 
take on the stock market.
Still another component of a risk model may be to govern the amount 
of overall portfolio leverage. Leverage can be controlled in a variety of ways. 
For example, one can manage money under the premise that when opportu-
nities abound, more leverage is desirable, whereas when fewer opportunities 
are present, less leverage is desirable. Alternatively, many quants attempt to 
offer their investors or bosses a relatively constant level of risk. Using vola-
tility and dispersion as proxies for risk, quants can measure the amount of 
risk in markets and vary their leverage accordingly to produce a more stable 
level of risk. The most common tool used for this purpose is known as a 
value at risk (VaR) model, but there are others that are similar philosophi-
cally. These models typically consider the dollar amount of exposures in a 
portfolio and, based on current levels of volatility, forecast how much the 
portfolio can be expected to gain or lose within a given confidence interval. 
For instance, most VaR models calculate what a daily single standard de-
viation move in portfolio returns will be, based on current volatility levels. 
The way that these models control risk in the face of rising volatility is to 
reduce leverage. Therefore, in general, the higher the reading of risk in a VaR 
model, the lower the level prescribed for leverage.
In Chapter 10, we discuss some of the significant problems with these 
kinds of risk models. For now I will simply point out that the core purpose 
of such risk models seems to me to be flawed. Other kinds of investments, 
such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, private equity, or fine wine, do not at-
tempt to offer fixed levels of volatility. Why should quants want to manage 
risk in this manner , or be asked to do so? Furthermore, if a quant is good at 
forecasting volatility or dispersion, there are far more interesting and pro-
ductive ways to utilize these forecasts (for example, in the options markets) 
than there are in a risk model that governs leverage. These kinds of models 
often cause traders to take too little risk in more normal times and too much 
risk in very turbulent times. Nevertheless, they are wildly popular .

## Page 92

A more theoretically sound approach, though substantially harder to 
implement practically, seeks to increase leverage when the strategy has bet-
ter odds of winning and to decrease risk when the strategy has worse odds. 
The trick, of course, is to know when the odds are on one’s side. Some 
quants solve this problem by allowing the level of leverage to vary with 
the overall strength and certainty of the predictions from the alpha model, 
which seems to be a reasonable approach.

Li M iting the t ypes of r isk
Though limiting the amount of an exposure is important, some approaches 
to risk modeling focus on eliminating whole types of exposure entirely. Im-
agine that an investor’s analysis indicates that Chevron Corporation (CVX) 
is likely to outperform Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). But the trade the 
investor makes is simply to go long CVX while ignoring XOM. If the mar -
ket drops precipitously afterward, or if the oil sector performs very poorly, 
the investor will most likely lose money on the trade, despite the correctness 
of his thesis. This is because the investor is exposed to market directional 
risk and to oil sector risk, even though he didn’t have any particular fore-
sight as to where the market or the oil sector was going. The investor could 
have substantially eliminated the unintentional or accidental market direc-
tion risk if he had expressed his analysis by buying CVX and shorting an 
equivalent amount of XOM. This way, whether the market rises, falls, or 
does nothing, he is indifferent. He is only affected by being right or wrong 
that CVX would outperform XOM.
As a general rule, it is always better to eliminate any unintentional ex-
posures, since there should be no expectation of being compensated suf-
ficiently for accepting them. Quantitative risk models designed to eliminate 
undesired exposures come in two familiar flavors: theoretical and empirical. 
Each is discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.
It is also worth noting that alpha models can (and often do) incor -
porate risk management concepts. Let’s assume that a quant is building a 
relative alpha strategy. A significant amount of work is required to match 
what “relative” means to the exposures he intends to take or hedge. Revisit-
ing an earlier example, if the quant is building a relative alpha strategy to 
forecast equity returns, he might not believe he has a valid way to forecast 
the returns of the sectors to which these equities belong. In this case, the 
quant may design his bet structures so that he is making forecasts of stocks’ 
returns relative to their sectors’ returns, which means that he never has a 
bet on the direction of the sector itself, only on which stocks will outper -
form and which stocks will underperform the sector . This, in turn, helps 

## Page 93

Risk Models  73
him eliminate sector bets, which is clearly a risk management exercise as 
much as it is alpha generation. As such, it is theoretically possible (and not 
infrequently seen in practice) to incorporate all the needed components of 
his risk model fully into his alpha model by specifying the alpha model such 
that it only forecasts exactly the exposures from which it expects to make 
money and structures its bets to avoid exposure to nonforecasted factors. 
Although not all quant strategies do this, it is worth remembering to look 
inside the alpha model for elements of risk management, especially for those 
evaluating a quant strategy.
t heory-Driven r isk Models
Theory‐driven risk modeling typically focuses on named or systematic risk 
factors. Just as in the case of theory‐driven alpha models, systematic risks 
that are derived from theory are those for which the quant can make a rea-
sonable, economic argument. Theory‐driven risk modeling uses a set of pre-
defined systematic risks, which enables the quant to measure and calibrate a 
given portfolio’s exposures.
It is important to note that the use of the term systematic in defining 
risk is completely different from the use of the term systematic in describ-
ing quant strategies. Systematic risks are those that cannot be diversified 
away. In the world of single stocks, the market itself is a systematic risk 
because no amount of diversification among various single stocks eliminates 
an investor’s exposure to the performance of the market itself. If the mar -
ket is up a lot, it is extremely likely that a portfolio that is long stocks is 
also going to be up. If the market is down a lot, it is extremely likely that a 
portfolio that is long stocks will be down. Sector risk is another example of 
systematic risk, as is market capitalization risk (i.e., small caps versus large 
caps). A practical example of such a problem, and one that has been well 
documented by the hedge fund replication crowd, is that an unconstrained 
market‐neutral value model will very likely be making a bet on small caps 
outperforming large caps.
3
The world of fixed income, similarly, contains a host of systematic risks. 
For example, whether one owns corporate bonds or government bonds, 
owners of these bonds are all subject to interest rate risk; that is, the risk 
that rates will go up, regardless of the level of diversification of the ac-
tual portfolio of bonds. Similar examples can be found in any asset class 
and frequently also across asset classes. Any economically valid grouping 
of instruments, in other words, can be said to share one or more common 
systematic risk factors. An investor who traffics in any of those instruments, 
then, should be aware of this risk factor and should be either making inten-
tional bets on it or eliminating his exposure.

e mpirical r isk Models
Empirical risk models are based on the same premise as theory‐driven mod-
els, namely that systematic risks should be measured and mitigated. How-
ever , the empirical approach uses historical data to determine what these 
risks are and how exposed a given portfolio is to them. Using statistical 
techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), a quant is able to 
use historical data to discern systematic risks that don’t have names but that 
may well correspond to named risk factors.
4 For example, a PCA run on 
bond market data using Treasury bonds across various maturities usually 
shows that the first (most important) risk factor statistically corresponds 
to the level of interest rates, or what a theory‐driven risk model might call 
interest rate risk. PCA and other statistical models are commonly used in eq-
uity markets as well, and these models typically find that the market itself is 
the first, most important driver of returns for a given stock, usually followed 
by its sector . These statistical risk models are most commonly found among 
statistical arbitrage traders, who are betting on exactly that component of 
an individual stock’s returns that is not explained by systematic risks. It is 
important to note that such statistical methods may discover entirely new 
systematic risk factors, which a reasonable observer might be inclined to 
acknowledge exist but for which names have not been assigned. On the 
other hand, statistical risk models are subject to being fooled by the data 
into finding a risk factor that will not persist for any useful amount of time 
into the future. It is also possible for a statistical risk model to find spurious 
exposures, which are just coincidences and not indicative of any real risk in 
the marketplace. This is a delicate problem for the researcher .
h ow Quants Choose a r isk Model
Quants are attracted to theory‐driven risk models because the risk factors 
they encapsulate make sense. It is hard to make the argument that market 
risk does not exist as a strong systematic risk factor in equities. Note that this 
is much the same reasoning that supports theoretical approaches to alpha 
modeling: Any reasonable person can understand the theory and see that it 
is likely to be true. This in turn can give the quant faith in the models when 
it isn’t performing very well. Warren Buffett, for example, didn’t change 
his stripes just because he dramatically underperformed the stock market 
during the Internet bubble. He was able to keep the faith in no small part 
because his approach to markets has very strong theoretical underpinnings.
Quants that choose empirical risk models typically seek the benefits of 
adaptiveness. Theoretical risk models are relatively rigid, meaning that the risk 
factors are not altered often (otherwise the theory would not have been very 
strong in the first place). Y et the factors that drive markets do change over 

## Page 95

time. For a while in early 2003, daily reports about the prospect, and later the 
progress, of the U.S. invasion of Iraq drove stock, bond, currency , and com-
modity markets almost singlehandedly . More recently , in early 2008, commod-
ity prices were a significant factor . At other times, expectations of how much 
the Federal Reserve might cut or raise rates are the key drivers of market be-
havior . As markets evolve, the data that the markets produce reflect this evolu-
tion, and these data drive empirical risk models. For these reasons, an empirical 
model may be more adaptive to ever‐changing market conditions by detect-
ing through new data whatever factors are implicitly driving markets. There 
are two stages to this adaptation. During the early phases of a market regime 
change (for example, when equity investors rapidly change their behavior from 
risk seeking to risk aversion), the quant is using now irrelevant historical data 
to determine relationships and measure risk factors. Thus, during this phase, 
the empirical risk model will be modeling market risks incorrectly . Later , if the 
new behavior persists, the empirical risk model eventually will catch up to the 
newly prevailing theme driving markets, and all will be well again.
Besides exhibiting a weakness during a regime change, a basic under -
standing of statistics reveals another problem with empirical risk models. T o 
achieve statistical significance and reduce the potential for measurement error 
in computing relationships among various instruments, empirical risk models 
require a rather large amount of data. But this leads to a trade-off that could 
squelch most of the adaptiveness benefits of empirical risk models. The more 
data that are used—that is, the further back into history we must look—the 
less adaptive a model can be, because each new data point is but one of a very 
large number . If we use two years’ worth of rolling daily data, or approximate-
ly 520 trading days, each new day adds a new data point and causes the oldest 
one to fall out of the sample. So for every day that passes, only two days’ data 
have changed out of 520. It will therefore take a long time to turn the ship and 
have the empirical model find the new drivers of risk from the data. However , 
if the quant attempts to improve adaptiveness by shortening the historical 
window used, the power of the statistics diminishes significantly so that there 
cannot be sufficient confidence in the measurements to act on them.
Still, there may be benefits to empirical risk models. If the theoretical 
risk models are any good at being right, an empirical model should capture 
these effects without having to know the names of the factors beforehand. 
If market risk is indeed a big driver of stock prices, an empirical model 
should pick this up from the data. If the data don’t bear it out, what good 
is the theory? Furthermore, the competing objectives of statistical signifi-
cance and adaptiveness can be dealt with in part by using intraday data. For 
example, if a quant uses one‐minute intraday snapshots of price activities 
instead of simply a single closing price for each day, he is able to extract 
almost 400 data points for each day in his sample, which allows him to use 

## Page 96

76  Ins I de the Black Box
far fewer days to achieve the same statistical significance as another quant 
using a single data point for each day (the closing price).
Ultimately , because of the comfort level with the concepts involved in the-
ory‐driven risk modeling, most quants tend to use theory‐driven risk models 
rather than empirical risk models. It is worth noting that these two kinds of risk 
models are not mutually exclusive. Quants may perfectly reasonably use a com-
bination of both, if they deem it appropriate. A small minority of managers also 
attempt to use their judgment and discretion to monitor market behavior and, 
should it become clear to them—for example, from the way that the financial 
media and their peers in the business are behaving—that there is a “new” risk 
factor that is driving markets, they build a made‐to‐order risk factor to measure 
this temporary phenomenon. When they see that the new driver has faded in 
importance, they can remove it from the risk model, again using their judgment.
It is worth mentioning that quants have the option, as is the case with 
most of the modules of the black box, to build their own risk model or to 
purchase one that is off the shelf. Most premade risk models are not of the 
empirical variety because empirical solutions require a specifically set uni -
verse of instruments, and the analytical techniques are usually relatively easy 
to implement with simple price data. Also, the vast majority of premade risk 
models are useful only for equity trading strategies. Several purveyors of risk 
models—such as BARRA, Northfield, Axioma, and Quantal—have made a 
healthy business of licensing their software to quant traders. The advantage 
of buying risk models is that they are ready to be deployed immediately , 
without extensive R&D by the quant trader , and usually at least reasonably 
well thought through. However , they are also by nature somewhat generic. 
There are advantages to building risk models as well, primarily because they 
can be customized to the specific needs of the particular quant trader .
s u MM ary
Risk management is frequently misunderstood to be an exercise designed to 
reduce risk. It is really about the selection and sizing of exposures, to maximize 
returns for a given level of risk. After all, reducing risk almost always comes at 
the cost of reducing return. So, risk management activities must focus on elimi-
nating or reducing exposure to unnecessary risks but also on taking risks that 
are expected to offer attractive payoffs. This is true whether one uses a system-
atic investment process or a discretionary one. The main difference between 
the two is that quants typically use software to manage risk, whereas discre-
tionary traders, if they use software in the risk management process at all, 
primarily attempt merely to measure risk in some way , without any systematic 
process for adjusting their positions in accordance with predefined guidelines.

## Page 97

Risk Models  77
Whether a quant uses a theoretical or empirical risk model or some 
hybrid thereof, the goal is the same: The quant wants to identify what sys-
tematic exposures are being taken, measure the amount of each exposure in 
a portfolio, and then make some determination about whether these risks 
are acceptable. What is good about these kinds of analyses, along with many 
of the other quantitative risk‐modeling approaches, is that they require the 
quant to be intentional about risk taking, rather than slapping together 
some positions that seem like good trades and more or less ignoring the inci-
dental exposures these trades may share. For example, if oil prices become a 
dominant theme in investors’ sentiment about the markets, positions across 
a variety of sectors and asset classes can be driven by oil. This can lead to 
a significant downside if a previously profitable trend in the price of oil re-
verses. A risk model may allow the quant to see this kind of exposure and 
make a choice about whether to do something about it. This is an important 
point. Quantitative approaches to risk management, by virtue of seeking to 
measure and make explicit what exposures are driving a portfolio, put the 
power into the hands of the portfolio manager to make rational, deliberate 
decisions. Of course, whether this intentionality is helpful or hurtful de-
pends on the judgment of the portfolio manager , even among quants. But at 
least quantitative risk management techniques offer the opportunity to see 
what risks are present in a portfolio and to what extent.
In the next chapter , we examine transaction cost models, which are the 
final providers of input to help determine the most desirable target port-
folio for a quant. Before doing so, let’s look at Exhibit 4.1 to examine our 
progress through this journey inside the black box.

is usually not much justification for its use, other than expediency for the pur -
poses of relatively easy computations to answer the question “How much risk 
is there?”.

This concept was formalized in the Kelly criterion, in a paper by John L. Kelly, 
Jr ., in the Bell System Technical Journal in 1956. The Kelly criterion provides 
a systematic way of sizing the risk taken on each of a series of bets based on 
the bettor’s edge, which maximizes the expected gains by the end of the series 
of bets. The edge is defined as a combination of the payoff for winning and 
the odds of winning. This concept has been widely applied in gambling and 
somewhat in investing. The noted quant Edward Thorp is credited with first 
applying the Kelly criterion to trading strategies. However , some critics of the 
Kelly betting strategy point out that a critical assumption of this criterion is that 
each bet is expected to be independent of the next, which is true in many forms 
of gambling, for example. However , in investing, bets can be serially correlated, 
which is to say that returns to investment strategies tend to be streaky. As such, 
in general many investors who believe in the concept of the Kelly criterion use 
a derivative version of the strategy, such as “half Kelly,” to bet less than Kelly 
suggests. Useful background on Kelly and the criterion can be found on William 
Poundstone’s website or in his book about Kelly, called Fortune’s Formula.

This phenomenon exists, if for no other reason, because the value investor tends 
to buy stocks that have fallen in price, which tend therefore to have experi-
enced a shrinkage in their market capitalization. A market‐neutral value inves-
tor would also tend to sell expensive stocks, which are likely to have rallied and 
therefore will have experienced market capitalization appreciation as well.

Principal components analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce 
the complexity of a set of instruments down to a manageable set of risk factors, 
each of which is called a vector. Each vector represents a statistically derived 
systematic risk among the instruments and is derived by analyzing the historical 
relationships among all the instruments in the set.

o far we have examined alpha models and risk models, both critical ele-
ments of the black box. The alpha model plays the role of the starry‐eyed 
optimist, and the risk model plays the role of the nervous worrier . In this 
metaphor , transaction cost models would be the frugal accountant.
The idea behind transaction cost models is that it costs money to trade, 
which means that one should not trade unless there is a very good reason 
to do so. This is not an overly draconian view of trading costs. Many highly 
successful quants estimate that their transaction costs eat away between 20 
and 50 percent of their returns.
In the world of quant trading, there are only two reasons to make 
a trade: first, if it improves the odds or magnitude of making money (as 
indicated by the alpha model), or second, if it reduces the odds or mag -
nitude of losing money (as indicated by the risk model). These reasons, 
however, are subject to a caveat: A tiny, incremental improvement in the 
reward or risk prospects of a portfolio might not be sufficient to over -
come the cost of trading. In other words, the benefits of the trade need to 
clear the hurdle of the cost of transacting. Neither the market nor your 
broker care what the benefits of a trade are. Rather, making a given trade 
utilizes services that cost the same regardless of the purpose or value the 
trade holds for the trader. A transaction cost model is a way of quantify -
ing the cost of making a trade of a given size so that this information can 
be used in conjunction with the alpha and risk models to determine the 
best portfolio to hold.

Note that transaction cost models are not designed to minimize the 
cost of trading, only to inform the portfolio construction engine of the 
costs of making any given trade. The part of the black box that minimizes 
costs is the execution algorithm, which we discuss at length in Chapter 7. 
It is less glamorous to describe costs than it is to minimize them, but the 
former remains critically important. If a trader underestimates the cost of 
transacting, this can lead to the system making too many trades that have 
insufficient benefit, which in turn leads to a problem of bleeding losses as 
a result of the constant acceptance of trading costs. If the trader overes -
timates the cost of transacting, this can lead to too little trading, which 
usually results in holding positions too long. Either way, the trader ends 
up with suboptimal performance, which highlights the importance of cor -
rectly estimating transaction costs. But there is also a trade‐off between us -
ing more complex models that more accurately describe transaction costs 
and using less complex models that are faster and less computationally 
burdensome.
Defining t ran S a C tion Co S t S
It is useful to understand what the costs of trading actually are, since we are 
describing ways to model them. Transaction costs have three major compo-
nents: commissions and fees, slippage, and market impact.
Commissions and f ees
Commissions and fees, the first kind of transaction costs, are paid to bro-
kerages, exchanges, and regulators for the services they provide, namely, 
access to other market participants, improved security of transacting, and 
operational infrastructure. For many quants, brokerage commission costs 
are rather small on a per‐trade basis. Quant traders typically do not utilize 
many of the services and personnel of the bank but instead use only the 
bank’s infrastructure to go directly to the market. The incremental cost of 
a trade to a bank is therefore very small, and even very low commissions 
can be profitable. Given the volume of trading that quants do, they can be 
extremely profitable clients for the brokerages, despite the diminutive com-
missions they pay. Some quants utilize significantly less of the bank’s infra-
structure and therefore pay even lower commission rates than others who 
use more and pay higher rates.
Commissions are not the only costs charged by brokerages and ex -
changes. Brokers charge fees (which are usually a component of the com -
missions) for services known as clearing and settlement . Clearing involves 

## Page 101

Transaction Cost Models  81
regulatory reporting and monitoring, tax handling, and handling failure, 
all of which are activities that must take place in advance of settlement. 
Settlement is the delivery of securities in exchange for payment in full, 
which is the final step in the life of a trading transaction and fulfills the 
obligations of both parties involved in the transaction. These services take 
effort and therefore cost money. And, given that many quants are doing 
tens of thousands of trades each day, there can be a significant amount of 
work involved.
Exchanges and electronic matching networks provide a different kind 
of service from conventional brokers, namely access to pools of liquidity. 
Exchanges must attract traders to their floors for trading, and this trading 
volume then attracts other traders who are seeking liquidity. Exchanges, 
too, have some operational effort to make by virtue of their roles, and they 
also guarantee that both counterparties in a given trade uphold their con-
tractual responsibilities. As such, exchanges also charge small fees for each 
transaction to cover their costs and risks (and, of course, to profit as a busi-
ness). More recently, dark pools, which are effectively matching engines to 
pair buyers and sellers of the same instrument at the same time within a 
given bank’s customer base, have come into prominence, and now account 
for a large percentage of all U.S. equity trading volumes (32 percent in 2012, 
according to the Tabb Group).
1
Slippage
Commissions and fees certainly are not negligible. But neither are they the 
dominant part of transaction costs for most quants. They are also basically 
fixed, which makes them easy to model. If the all‐in commissions and fees 
add up to, say, $0.001 per share, the quant must simply know that the trade 
in question is worth more in terms of alpha generation or risk reduction 
than this $0.001 per‐share hurdle. On the other hand, slippage and market 
impact are considerably trickier to measure, model, and manage.
Slippage is the change in the price between the time a trader (or quant 
system) decides to transact and the time when the order is actually at the 
exchange for execution. The market is constantly moving, but a trading 
decision is made as of a specific point in time. As time passes between 
the decision being made and the trade being executed, the instrument be -
ing forecast is likely to be moving away from the price at which it was 
quoted when the forecast was made. In fact, the more accurate the fore -
cast, the more likely it is that the price of the instrument is actually going 
toward the expected price as more time passes. But the instrument makes 
this move without the trader benefiting, because he has not yet gotten 
his trade to market. Imagine a trader decides to sell 100 shares of CVX 

## Page 102

82  Ins I de the Black Box
while the price is at $100.00 per share. When the trader finally gets the 
order through his broker and to the exchange, the price has gone down to 
$99.90 per share, for a decline of $0.10 per share. This $0.10 per share is 
a cost of the transaction because the trader intended to sell at $100.00, but 
in fact the price had already moved down to $99.90. In the event that the 
price actually moves up from $100.00 to $100.10, the trader gets to sell 
at a higher price, which means that slippage can sometimes be a source of 
positive return.
Strategies that tend to suffer most from slippage are those that pursue 
trend‐following strategies, because they are seeking to buy and sell instru-
ments that are already moving in the desired direction. Strategies that tend 
to suffer least from slippage, and for which slippage can sometimes be a pos-
itive, are those that are mean reverting in orientation, because these strate-
gies are usually trying to buy and sell instruments that are moving against 
them when the order is placed. A quant trader’s latency or speed to market 
has a large effect on the level of slippage his strategy will experience over 
time. This is because slippage is a function of the amount of time that passes 
between the order being decided and the order reaching the market for ex-
ecution. The more latency in a trader’s system or communications with the 
marketplace, the more time passes before her order gets to the market and 
the further the price of an instrument is likely to have moved away from the 
price when the decision was made. Worse still, the more accurate a forecast, 
particularly in the near term, the more damaging slippage will be.
In addition to time, slippage is also a function of the volatility of the 
instrument being forecast. If we are forecasting 90‐day Treasury bills, which 
tend to move very slowly throughout the day and which can go some weeks 
without much movement at all, it is likely that slippage is not a major factor . 
On the other hand, if we are forecasting a high‐volatility Internet stock, slip-
page can be a major issue. Google, Inc. (GOOG) has had an average daily 
range of 2.6 percent of its opening price, which is about 16 times larger than 
its average move from one day to the next. Clearly, slippage makes a huge 
difference if you’re trading GOOG.
Market i mpact
Market impact, the third and final major component of transaction costs, 
is perhaps the most important for quants. The basic problem described by 
market impact is that, when a trader goes to buy an instrument, the price 
of the instrument tends to go up, partly as a result of the trader’s order . If 
the trader sells, the price goes down as he attempts to complete his trade. 
At small order sizes, this price movement usually bounces between the cur -
rent best bid and offer . However , for larger orders, the price move can be 

## Page 103

Transaction Cost Models  83
substantial, ranging in the extremes, even to several percentage points. Mar-
ket impact, then, is a measurement of how much a given order moves the 
market by its demand for liquidity. Market impact is normally defined as the 
difference between the price at the time a market order enters the exchange 
and the price at which the trade is actually executed.
The basic idea behind market impact is simple enough and is based 
on the ubiquitous principle of supply and demand. When a trader goes to 
market to execute a trade for some size, someone has to be willing to take 
the other side, or supply the size he is looking to trade. The bigger the size 
of the demand by a trader , the more expensive the trade will be because the 
trader must access more of the supply. As simple as the idea of market im-
pact is, quantifying it is actually not so straightforward. One doesn’t know 
how much a particular trade impacts the market until the trade has already 
been completed, which may be too late to be useful. Also, there are many 
other factors that can drive a given observation of market impact and that 
can complicate its measurement. For example, the number of other trades 
that are being made in the same direction at the same time or whether news 
in the stock is causing impact to behave differently from normal are both 
issues that would affect measurements of market impact and are nontrivial 
to quantify. These other factors are also usually impossible to predict, much 
less control. Therefore, market impact as used in transaction cost modeling 
usually does not account for these factors but rather focuses on the size of 
the order relative to the liquidity present at the time. Liquidity can be de-
fined in a number of ways, whether by the size available at the bid or offer 
or by measurements of the depth of book, which relate to those bids or of-
fers that have been placed away from the best bid/offer prices.
In addition, there could be some interaction between slippage and mar-
ket impact that makes it tricky to segregate these two concepts in a model. 
A stock might be trending upward while a trader is trying to sell it, for 
example. In this case, both slippage and impact could look like negative 
numbers. In other words, the trader might deduce that he was actually paid, 
not charged, to sell the stock. For instance, assume that a trader decides to 
enter a market order to sell a stock he owns, and at that moment, the stock’s 
price happens to be $100.00. But by the time his order hits the market, the 
stock, continuing its trend upward, is now trading at $100.05. Slippage is 
actually negative $0.05 because his order entered the marketplace at a more 
favorable price than the one at which he decided to sell. But now assume 
that the price continues to drift upward as his order makes its way to the 
front of the line of sale orders, simply because the marketplace’s demand to 
buy the shares might simply overwhelm the orders, including his, to sell it. 
The trader ultimately sells his stock at $100.20, generating negative market 
impact of $0.15 on top of the negative slippage of $0.05. Clearly, entering 

## Page 104

sell orders does not usually make stocks go up, but in this case, it might not 
be possible to differentiate impact from slippage or either concept from the 
move the stock was making independently of the trader’s order . Did his sell 
order slow the rise of the stock somewhat, and if so, by how much? These 
are the kinds of complications that traders must account for in building 
transaction cost models.
Some kinds of trades further complicate the measurement of transac-
tion costs. We have discussed trades that demand liquidity from the market-
place, and these behave as one might expect intuitively: If a trader demands 
liquidity, there is a cost charged by those providing it. Looking at this from 
the opposite perspective, someone gets paid to supply liquidity. Historically, 
the party that supplied liquidity was a market maker or specialist whose 
job it was to make sure that traders can execute an order when they want 
to. More recently, volumes across many electronically tradable instruments 
have increased sufficiently to allow for well‐functioning marketplaces with-
out the presence of a market maker in the middle.
Electronic communication networks (ECNs) are examples of platforms 
for customers to trade directly with one another . The challenge for ECNs 
is to attract enough customer order flow to show abundant liquidity on 
their exchanges. ECNs also must provide robust technology so that their 
exchanges can continue to function without disruption. T o attract providers 
of liquidity, most ECNs in equity markets have established methods to pay 
traders who provide liquidity and take payment from traders who demand 
liquidity. It might cost something like three‐tenths of a penny per share for 
a trader who buys shares at the offer or sells shares at the bid, whereas 
those providing the bids and offers that are getting hit are earning closer to 
two‐tenths of a penny. The ECN keeps the difference, around one‐tenth of 
a penny per share, as its source of revenue. Some kinds of trading strategies 
(usually mean reversion strategies) actually call for a mostly passive execu-
tion approach in which this act of providing liquidity is modeled as a source 
of profit due to the rebate programs that ECNs put in place to attract liquid-
ity providers. It is worth noting that some ECNs and exchanges, especially 
outside of the equities markets, offer no rebates and do not charge custom-
ers to take liquidity. There are also inverse exchanges, which pay takers of 
liquidity and charge providers of liquidity.
Dark pools  also allow customers to interact with one another . Dark 
pools are created by brokers or independent firms to allow their customers 
to trade directly with each other in an anonymous way. They arose in part 
because of concerns about the market impact associated with large orders. 
On a dark pool, there is no information provided about the limit order 
book, which contains all the liquidity being provided by market makers 
and other participants. Customers are simply posting their orders to the 

## Page 105

Transaction Cost Models  85
pool and if someone happens to want to do the opposite side of those or -
ders, the orders get filled. As a result of this anonymous process of match -
ing orders, the market is less likely to move as much as it would in a more 
public venue, where automated market making practitioners require com -
pensation to take the other side of large orders. One fact that makes dark 
pool transactions somewhat unusual is that they are over‐the‐counter , off‐
exchange transactions in instruments that are exchange traded. Dark pools 
could not exist without the public markets, because the securities traded on 
dark pools are listed on public exchanges. Furthermore, the public markets 
provide the only transparent sense of price discovery, without which dark 
pool participants would have a significantly harder time determining what 
prices to bid and offer . Partly because of these issues, coupled with the fact 
that dark pools are available only to selected customers, controversy sur -
rounds dark pools.

There are four basic types of transaction cost models—flat, linear , piece -
wise‐linear , and quadratic—all of which are trying to answer the basic 
question of how much it will cost to transact a given trade. Some of these 
costs are fixed and known—for example, commissions and fees. Models 
of transaction costs use these fixed charges as a baseline, below which the 
expense of trading cannot go. Other costs, such as slippage and impact, 
are variable and cannot be known precisely until they have been incurred. 
Slippage is affected by a number of factors, such as the volatility of the 
instrument in question (i.e., the higher the volatility, the greater the expec -
tation of slippage) or its prevailing trend (i.e., the stronger the trend, the 
more slippage is likely to cost if one attempts to transact in the direction 
of the trend). Impact also has many drivers, including the size of the order 
being executed, the amount of liquidity that happens to be available to 
absorb the order , and imbalances between supply and demand for the in -
strument at the moment. Traders use transaction cost models in an attempt 
to develop reasonable expectations for the cost of an order of various sizes 
for each name they trade.
It is worth mentioning that each instrument has its own unique char -
acteristics based on the investor base that tends to transact in it and the 
amount of liquidity and volatility present in the instrument over time. 
GOOG doesn’t trade exactly like Amazon (AMZN), and CVX doesn’t 
trade exactly like XOM. As a result, in an effort to improve their esti -
mates of transaction costs, many quants build separate models for trans -
action costs for each instrument in their portfolios and allow each of 

## Page 106

86  Ins I de the Black Box
these models to evolve over time based on the trading data the quant col -
lects from his execution systems. In other words, many transaction cost 
models are highly empirical, allowing the actual, observable, recorded 
transaction data from a quant’s own strategy to drive and evolve the 
model over time.
The total cost of transactions for an instrument, holding all else con-
stant (such as liquidity, trend, or volatility), can be visualized as a graph with 
the size of the order (in terms of dollars, shares, contracts, or the like) on 
the x‐axis and the cost of trading on the y‐axis. It is generally accepted by 
the quant community that the shape of this curve is quadratic, which means 
that the cost gets higher ever more quickly as the size of the trade gets larger 
(due to market impact). Certainly many quants do model transaction costs 
as a quadratic function of the size of the trade (more on this later). However , 
modeling transaction costs this way can be more complicated and compu-
tationally intensive, whereas the other choices of modeling transaction costs 
are simpler and less intensive.
With advances in computer hardware and processors, the extra compu-
tational burdens are now rather easily managed, but that does not alter the 
fact that a proper quadratic cost function is inherently more complicated. 
These functions, from the simplest to the most complex, are described in the 
following sections.
f lat t ransaction Cost Models
The first kind of transaction cost model is a flat model, which means that 
the cost of trading is the same, regardless of the size of the order . This 
is extremely straightforward computationally, but it is rarely correct and 
is not widely used. A graph of a flat transaction cost model is shown in 
Exhibit 5.1.
As you can see, this graph models the cost of a trade as being fixed, 
regardless of the size of the trade, which is an assumption that seems obvi-
ously incorrect in most circumstances. The main circumstance in which such 
a model is reasonable is if the size being traded is nearly always about the 
same and liquidity remains sufficiently constant. In this case, one can simply 
figure out the total cost of such a trade and assume that it will always cost 
the same. This assumption is wrong, but being wrong has no consequence 
because the size of the trade is always the same. Note that where the solid 
line crosses the dashed line, the model is close to a correct estimate of trans-
action costs. So, if this point of intersection corresponds to the size of trad-
ing normally done, and if the range of that trade size is within the region 
where the flat line is close to the curved line, a flat t‐cost model may not be 
problematic.

## Page 107

ransaction Cost Models
The second kind of transaction cost model is linear, which means that the 
cost of a transaction gets larger with a constant slope as the size of the trans-
action grows larger , as shown in Exhibit 5.2. This is a better fit relative to 
the true transaction cost, but it is still mostly useful as a shortcut to building 
a proper model.
As you can see, the linear transaction cost model must trade off over -
estimating costs at smaller trade sizes with underestimating costs at larger 
trade sizes. Here, again, the model is correct where the solid line crosses the 
dashed line and is close to correct in the immediate vicinity of that intersec-
tion. As with the flat t‐cost model, if the trades being done are always within 
that region, a linear t‐cost model is reasonable. In any case, across the curve, 
it appears to be a better estimator of the real transaction cost than is given 
by the flat transaction cost model.
p iecewise- l inear t ransaction Cost Models
Piecewise‐linear transaction cost models are used to help with precision 
while using reasonably simple formulas to do so. The idea of a piecewise‐
linear transaction cost model is that, in certain ranges, a linear estimate is 
about right, but at some point, the curvature of the quadratic estimator 
causes a significant enough rise in the slope of the real transaction cost line

that it is worthwhile to use a new line from that point on. This concept is 
illustrated in Exhibit 5.3.
As you can see, the accuracy of this type of model is significantly better 
than what can be achieved with flat or linear models across a much wider 
range of trading sizes; as a result, this model is rather popular among quants 
as a happy medium between simplicity and accuracy.

Quadratic

ransaction Cost Models
Finally, quants can build quadratic models of transaction costs. These are 
computationally the most intensive because the function involved is not 
nearly as simple as what is used for a linear model, or even for a piece -
wise‐linear model. It has multiple terms and exponents, and generally is 
a pain to build. A plot of a quadratic transaction cost model is shown in 
Exhibit 5.4.
This is clearly the most accurate estimate we have seen of transac -
tion costs. And yet it is not perfect, and it is significantly more difficult 
to build and utilize than a linear or piecewise linear model. You might be 
wondering how it is that we have estimated a quadratic function using a 
quadratic function and still ended up with a less than perfect estimate of 
the true transaction cost. The reason is that the solid line reflects what is 
expected, whereas the dotted line reflects what is actually observed after the 
fact. This is a significant difference because the solid line must be specified 
before trading, whereas the dotted line is what is observed empirically after 
trading. Because the actual transaction cost is an empirically observable 
fact and any estimation of transaction costs is a prediction, the prediction 
is unlikely to be perfect. Causes of differences between estimated and real -
ized transaction costs might include changes in liquidity or volatility in the 
instrument over time or changes in the types of traders (e.g., market mak -
ers, hedge funds, mutual funds, or retail investors) who are transacting in

the same stock over time. Of course, the quant is trying as hard as possible 
to make good forecasts, but given that it is known that the forecast is very 
unlikely to be perfect and that speed and simplicity are both also desirable, 
the trade‐off between accuracy and simplicity is one that requires the judg -
ment of the quant.
Regardless of the type of model used, the quant must describe the cost 
of trading each instrument in her universe. After all, a less liquid small cap 
stock is likely to be more expensive to trade than a more liquid mega cap 
stock, and that must be a factor in deciding how much of each to trade. 
Furthermore, the quant should refresh empirical estimations of transac -
tion costs both to keep the model current with the prevailing market con -
ditions as well as to indicate when more research is required to improve 
the model itself.
Su MM ary
The role of transaction cost models is simply to advise the portfolio con -
struction model how much it might cost to transact. Its job is not  to mini-
mize the cost of trading, just as the job of the alpha model is not to gen -
erate returns but rather to make forecasts and to provide these forecasts 
to the portfolio construction model. Cost minimization happens in two 
phases. First, the portfolio construction model, using the input provided 
by the transaction cost model, accounts for cost in generating a target 
portfolio. Second, the target portfolio is passed along to the execution 
algorithms, which explicitly attempt to transact the desired portfolio as 
cheaply as possible.
There are several kinds of transaction models, ranging from extremely 
simple to rather complex. The simpler models are useful for traders who ei-
ther do trades of roughly the same size in a given instrument all the time or 
who trade in such small sizes that they can simply assume a modest cost and 
be close to correct most of the time. The more complex models are useful for 
quants who have the potential to trade significant, or significantly variable, 
quantities of a given instrument in a short period. Any of the four models 
described here can be valid in the right set of circumstances. The question 
to consider is whether the model chosen fits the application and facts of the 
situation.
We turn our attention next to portfolio construction models, which 
utilize the inputs provided by the alpha, risk, and transaction cost models 
described over the past three chapters, and come up with a target portfolio 
designed to maximize returns relative to risk. But first we check our progress 
on the map of the black box in Exhibit 5.5.

No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into 
account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be.

T
he goal of a portfolio construction model is to determine what portfolio 
the quant wants to own. The model acts like an arbitrator , hearing the 
arguments of the optimist (alpha model), the pessimist (risk model), and the 
cost‐conscious accountant (transaction cost model), and then making a de-
cision about how to proceed. The decision to allocate this or that amount to 
the various holdings in a portfolio is mostly based on a balancing of consid-
erations of expected return, risk, and transaction costs. T oo much emphasis 
on the opportunity can lead to ruin by ignoring risk. T oo much emphasis 
on the risk can lead to underperformance by ignoring the opportunity. T oo 
much emphasis on transaction costs can lead to paralysis because this will 
tend to cause the trader to hold positions indefinitely instead of taking on 
the cost of refreshing the portfolio.
Quantitative portfolio construction models come in two major forms. 
The first family is rule based. Rule‐based portfolio construction models are 
based on heuristics defined by the quant trader and can be exceedingly sim-
ple or rather complex. The heuristics that are used are generally rules that 
are derived from human experience, such as by trial and error .
The second family of quantitative portfolio construction models is op-
timized. Optimizers utilize algorithms—step‐by‐step sets of rules designed 
to get the user from a starting point to a desired ending point—to seek 
the best way to reach a goal that the quant defines. This goal is known as 
an objective function, and the canonical example of an objective function 
for an optimizer is to seek the portfolio that generates the highest possible

return for a unit of risk. By their nature, optimizers can be more difficult to 
understand in great detail, but they are straightforward conceptually.
As in the case of blending alpha models, discussed in Chapter 3, portfo-
lio construction models are a fascinating area to study. Furthermore, port-
folio construction turns out to be a critical component of the investment 
process. If a trader has a variety of investment ideas of varying quality but 
allocates the most money to the worst ideas and the least money to the best 
ideas, it is not hard to imagine this trader delivering poor results over time. 
At a minimum, his results would be greatly improved if he could improve his 
approach to portfolio construction. And yet, actual solutions to the problem 
of how to allocate assets across the various positions in a portfolio are not 
exceedingly common. This subject receives rather a lot less time and space 
in the academic journals and in practitioners’ minds than ways to make a 
new alpha model, for example. This chapter will give you the ability to un-
derstand how most quant practitioners tackle this problem.
r ule-Based p or T folio Cons T ru CT ion Models
There are four common types of rule‐based portfolio construction models: 
equal position weighting, equal risk weighting, alpha‐driven weighting, and 
decision‐tree weighting. The first two are the simplest and have at their core 
a philosophy of equal weighting; they differ only in what specifically is be-
ing equally weighted. Alpha‐driven portfolio construction models mainly 
rely on the alpha model for guidance on the correct position sizing and 
portfolio construction. Decision‐tree approaches, which look at a defined 
set of rules in a particular order to determine position sizing, can be rather 
simple or amazingly complex. I describe these approaches from simplest to 
most complex.
e qual p osition Weighting
Equal position‐weighted models are surprisingly common. These models are 
used by those who implicitly (or explicitly) believe that if a position looks 
good enough to own, no other information is needed (or even helpful) in de-
termining its size. There is a further implicit assumption that the instruments 
are homogeneous enough that they do not need to be distinguished on the 
basis of their riskiness or otherwise. The notion of the strength of a signal, 
which, as already discussed, is related to the size of a forecast for a given in-
strument, is ignored except insofar as the signal is strong enough to be wor-
thy of a position at all. At first glance, this might seem like an oversimpli-
fication of the problem. However , some serious quants have arrived at this 

## Page 115

Portfolio Construction Models  95
solution. The basic premise behind an equal-weighting model is that any 
attempt to differentiate one position from another has two potentially ad-
verse consequences, which ultimately outweigh any potential benefit from 
an unequal weighting. In other words, they choose an equal‐weighting mod-
el because of the many disadvantages they see in unequal weighting.
The first potential problem with unequal weighting is that it assumes 
implicitly that there is sufficient statistical strength and power to predict not 
only the direction of a position in the future but also the magnitude and/
or probability of its move relative to the other forecasts in the portfolio. 
Quants utilizing equal‐weighting schemes believe, instead, that the alpha 
model is only to be trusted enough to forecast direction, and as long as there 
is sufficient confidence in a forecast of direction that is sufficiently large to 
justify trading the instrument at all, it is worth trading at the same size as 
any other position.
The second potential problem with unequal weighting of a portfolio 
is that it generally leads to a willingness to take a few large bets on the 
“best” forecasts and many smaller bets on the less dramatic forecasts. This 
weighting disparity, however , may lead to the strategy’s taking excess risk of 
some idiosyncratic event in a seemingly attractive position. This can be the 
case regardless of the type of alpha used to make a forecast. For instance, 
in momentum‐oriented strategies, many of the strongest signals are those 
for which the underlying instrument has already moved the most (i.e., has 
showed the strongest trending behavior). In other words, it might be too 
late, and the trader risks getting his strongest signals at the peak of the trend, 
just as it reverses. Similarly, for mean reversion–oriented strategies, many of 
the largest signals are also for those instruments that have already moved 
the most and are now expected to snap back aggressively. But frequently, 
large moves happen because there is real information in the marketplace 
that leads to a prolonged or extended trend. This phenomenon is known to 
statisticians as adverse selection bias. Mean reversion bets in these situations 
are characterized as “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller ,” which is a 
colorful way of saying that betting on a reversal against a very strong trend 
leads to being run over if the trend continues, which it often does.
This last benefit can be seen in other scenarios as well. While practition-
ers do what they can to clean the data they utilize in trading (which we dis-
cuss further in Chapter 8), there are occasions in which bad data points end 
up filtering into a trading strategy. Equal weighting positions, in particular 
if there are many of them, ensure that the risk of loss associated with the 
large forecasts that could result from significantly wrong data does not get 
out of hand. For example, if a stock price is off by a factor of 100 (e.g., it 
is quoted in pence instead of pounds, as happens occasionally in U.K. equi-
ties), it is likely that an alpha model might be fooled into wanting to take 

## Page 116

96  Ins I de the Black Box
an enormous position in this ticker . An equal-weighting scheme can reduce 
the size of that position such that it does not end up a catastrophic event.
Indeed, since alphas are generally tested against real datasets, most of 
their statistical significance and strength generally come from the meat of a 
distribution, not from the tails. If we observe a real tail event (not just some 
accident of a bad data point) that drives a large alpha forecast, this is per -
haps a better trade, but it almost certainly involves dramatically higher risk 
than a more normative level of alpha. Here, too, an equal position weighting 
scheme can control the risk associated with such tail observations.
Analogous arguments can be made for almost all alpha strategies, mak-
ing it easy to construct good arguments against unequal‐weighting posi-
tions. Therefore, the basic argument in favor of an equal‐weighted approach 
is one of mitigating risk by diversifying bets across the largest useful number 
of positions. It is worth mentioning that equal weights are sometimes subject 
to constraints of liquidity, in that a position is weighted as close to equally as 
its liquidity will allow. Such liquidity considerations can be applied to each 
of the other rule‐based allocation methodologies discussed in this chapter .
e qual r isk Weighting
Equal risk weighting adjusts position sizes inversely to their volatilities (or 
whatever other measure of risk, such as drawdown, is preferred). More vol-
atile positions are given smaller allocations, and less volatile positions are 
given larger allocations. In this way, each position is equalized in the portfo-
lio, not by the size of the allocation but rather by the amount of risk that the 
allocation contributes to the portfolio. An example is shown in Exhibit 6.1,  
which shows an example of a two‐stock portfolio. As you can see, the more 
volatile stock (GOOG) gets a smaller allocation in the portfolio than the less 
volatile stock (XOM).
The rationale is straightforward. A small‐cap stock with a significant 
amount of price volatility might not deserve quite the same allocation as a 
mega cap stock with substantially less volatility. Putting an equal number 
of dollars into these two positions might in fact be taking a much larger 
and inadvertent real bet on the small cap stock. This is because the small 
cap stock is much more volatile, and therefore every dollar allocated to that

stock would move the portfolio more than the same dollars allocated to 
the larger cap (and, likely, less volatile) position. As such, some quants who 
believe that equal weighting is the most appropriate method will utilize an 
equal risk–weighting approach in an effort to improve the true diversifica-
tion achieved.
However , the equal risk–weighting approach also has its shortcomings. 
Whatever unit of risk is equalized, it is almost always a backward‐looking 
measurement, such as volatility. Instruments with higher volatilities would 
have smaller allocations, whereas lower‐volatility instruments would have 
larger allocations. But what if the less volatile instruments suddenly became 
the more volatile? This is not merely a hypothetical question. For many 
years, bank stocks were very stable. Then, in 2008, they suddenly became 
highly volatile, more so even than many technology stocks. Any backward‐
looking analysis of the volatility of stocks that didn’t emphasize the last 
debacle among financial stocks (10 years earlier , in 1998) would likely have 
been misled by the steady behavior of these stocks for the decade prior to 
2008, and therefore an equal‐risk model is likely to have held much larger 
positions in banks than were warranted once volatility spiked in 2008.
a lpha- d riven Weighting
A third approach to rule‐based portfolio construction determines position 
sizes based primarily on the alpha model. The idea here is that the alpha 
model dictates how attractive a position is likely to be, and this signal is 
the best way to size the position correctly. Still, most quants who utilize this 
approach would not allow the size of the largest position to be unlimited. 
As such, they would use the risk model to provide a maximum size limit for 
a single position. Given the limit, the strength of the signal determines how 
close to the maximum the position can actually be. This is much like grad-
ing on a curve, where the best score receives the largest position size, and 
the scores below the best receive smaller sizes. The types of constraints used 
with this approach to portfolio construction can also include limits on the 
size of the total bet on a group (e.g., sector or asset class).
For example, one could constrain individual positions to be less than 
3 percent of the portfolio and each sector to be less than 20 percent. There 
still needs to be a function that relates the magnitude of the forecast to 
the size of the position, but these functions can be straightforward, and in 
general, the bigger the forecast, the larger the position. Alpha weighting is 
favored by some quants because it emphasizes making money, which is af-
ter all the goal of the whole exercise. However , some quant strategies, such 
as futures trend following, that utilize this method can suffer sharp draw-
downs relatively frequently. This is because these models usually have the 

## Page 118

98  Ins I de the Black Box
largest signals when a price trend is already well established. As the trend 
proceeds, the size of the position grows, but this will often leave the trader 
with his largest position just when the trend reverses. Caution is therefore 
advisable when utilizing an alpha‐driven portfolio construction algorithm, 
because such an approach causes a heavy reliance on the alpha model being 
right—not only about its forecast of the direction of an instrument but also 
about the size of the move the instrument will make.
s ummary of r ule-Based p ortfolio Construction Models
Regardless of which type of rule‐based portfolio construction model is used, 
the alpha model, risk model, and t‐cost model can be incorporated in port-
folio building. In an equal‐weighted model, for example, constraints on the 
equal weighting can exist because certain instruments are too expensive to 
transact in, according to the transaction cost model. These considerations 
can be accounted for within the alpha model itself, for example by adding 
a conditioning variable that sets the expected return (or score, or whatever 
other form of forecast) to “0” if the expected return is less than the expected 
transaction cost threshold. Thus, any signal that comes out of the alpha 
model can now be equally weighted. Obviously, the exact nature of the in-
teraction between the other components of the black box and the portfolio 
construction model depends entirely on the type of portfolio construction 
model. For example, an equal-weighting approach may make use of a risk 
model in an entirely different way from an alpha‐weighting approach.
T o summarize, rule‐based portfolio construction models can be ex-
tremely simple (as in the case of an equal‐weighted portfolio) or rather com-
plex (in the case of an alpha‐weighting with many types of constraints). 
The challenge common to all of them is to make the rules that drive them 
rational and well‐reasoned.

Portfolio optimization is one of the most important topics in quantitative 
finance. This is one of the first areas in quant finance to receive the attention 
of serious academic work; in fact, the case could easily be made that the 
father of quantitative analysis is Harry Markowitz, who published a land-
mark paper entitled “Portfolio Selection. ”
1 He invented a technique known 
as mean variance optimization, which is still ubiquitous today, though much 
sophistication has been built around its core. In 1990, he shared a Nobel 
Prize with William Sharpe for both their contributions to the understanding 
of the quantitative analysis of portfolio construction.

Portfolio Construction Models  99
Portfolio optimizers are based on the principles of modern portfolio 
theory (MPT), which are canonical in the asset management industry. The 
core tenet of MPT is that investors are inherently risk averse, meaning that 
if two assets offer the same return but different levels of risk, investors will 
prefer the less risky asset. A corollary is that investors will take on extra risk 
only if they expect to receive extra return as compensation. This introduced 
the concept of risk‐adjusted return. Mean variance optimization is a formal 
way of building portfolios based on MPT . Mean and variance are two of 
the inputs to the optimizer , and the output is a set of portfolios that have 
the highest return at each level of risk. The mean in question is the average 
expected return of each asset being evaluated. Variance is a proxy for the 
expected risk of each asset and is computed as the standard deviation of 
the returns of the various assets one is considering owning. A third input to 
the optimizer is the expected correlation matrix of these same assets. Using 
these inputs, the optimizer delivers a set of portfolios that offer the highest 
possible return for various levels of risk, known as the efficient frontier.
Quant trading strategies that utilize risk and transaction cost models, 
in addition to alpha models, also need to account for the information con-
tained in (and any constraints associated with) those models. For exam-
ple, the portfolio optimizer might be required to solve for the optimal (i.e., 
maximum risk‐adjusted return) portfolio, which accounts for the expected 
returns of each potential holding, the variability of those holdings, the cor -
relation of those holdings to one another , and which minimizes exposure to 
various prespecified risk factors as specified in the risk model. Several addi-
tional inputs are utilized by quants in real trading applications, including (a) 
the size of the portfolio in currency terms; (b) the desired risk level (usually 
measured in terms of volatility or expected drawdown); and (c) any other 
constraints, such as a hard‐to‐borrow list provided by a prime broker in eq-
uity trading, which reduces the size of the universe with which the optimizer 
can work. These inputs are not required by the optimizer , and the first two 
are also mostly arbitrary, but they help yield a portfolio that is practical and 
useful to the quant trader .
The reason this technique is known as optimization is that it seeks to 
find the maximum (optimal) value of a function that has been specified by 
the researcher . This function is known as the objective function, where ob-
jective is used in the sense of goal. The optimizer seeks this goal by an algo-
rithm that conducts a directed search among the various combinations of 
instruments available to it. As it examines the return and risk characteristics 
of a given combination, it compares this with previously examined combi-
nations and detects what seems to cause the portfolio’s behavior to improve 
or degrade. By this method, the optimizer is able to rapidly locate a series 
of optimal portfolios, which are those for which returns cannot be bested 

## Page 120

100  Ins I de the Black Box
by those of any other portfolio at a given level of risk. What is allowed or 
disallowed is determined by the alpha model, risk model, and transaction 
cost model. The objective function that many quants use is the same as 
the original: maximizing the return of a portfolio relative to the volatility 
of the portfolio’s returns. However , an infinite array of objective functions 
can be used. For example, one could specify an objective function that will 
cause the optimizer to maximize portfolio return relative to peak‐to‐valley 
drawdown instead of return volatility. The use of return versus risk is itself 
entirely optional, and one could very easily optimize an objective function 
focused entirely on the total expected return of a portfolio.
We can graphically illustrate the technique of optimization as shown in 
Exhibit 6.2. Here, we see that on the X (horizontal) and Z (depth) axes of 
the graph are every possible combination of ownerships of two imaginary 
instruments, ABC and DEF . The Y‐axis (vertical) shows the expected Sharpe 
ratio of each possible portfolio containing ABC and DEF . The Sharpe ratio 
was chosen simply for illustrative purposes, as a typical objective function 
for an optimizer . Imagine further that we have a positive return expecta-
tion (forecast) on ABC, and an equal but negative forecast for DEF . The 
optimizer searches for which portfolio produces the maximum value for 
the objective function, which in this case is to be 100 percent long ABC and

i nputs to o ptimization
The inputs required for an optimizer , as already mentioned, are expected 
returns, expected volatility, and a correlation matrix of the various instru-
ments to be considered for the portfolio. It is worth understanding where 
practitioners get the estimates and expectations used in optimization, since 
they are critical to the model itself. We consider each of the aforementioned 
inputs in order .
e

eturn
 
In more traditional finance, such as private wealth manage-
ment, expected returns are usually set to equal very long‐term historical 
returns because usually the goal is to create a strategic asset allocation that 
won’t need to be dynamically readjusted. By contrast, quants tend to use 
their alpha models to drive expected return. As we mentioned in our discus-
sion of alpha models, the output of the alpha model typically includes an 
expected return and/or an expected direction, or some other output that 
indicates the attractiveness of each potential portfolio holding (e.g., a score). 
Forecasts of direction can be used as forecasts of return simply by making 
all positive forecasts equal and all negative forecasts equal (often subject to 
minimum threshold parameters, so that at least the return forecasts have to 
be of some significant size before making a bet). In this kind of optimization, 
it is not important to have a precise forecast of return, but rather a forecast 
of the attractiveness of each potential position in terms of the expected re-
turn. So directional forecasts are indifferent between the expected return of 
each position, and the only relevant feature of the forecast is its sign.
e
xpected Volatility
 
Many practitioners, whether in traditional finance or in 
quant trading, tend to use historical measures for the second input to the 
optimizer , namely volatility. Some, however , develop and use their own fore-
casts of volatility. The most common approaches to forecasting volatility 
utilize stochastic volatility models. Stochastic, in Greek, means random. In 
statistics, a stochastic process is one that is somewhat predictable but that 
has some element of unpredictability or randomness built in. In case you’re 
wondering what statisticians mean by the word process, they are referring 
to some continuous series of changes, which is basically a synonym for a 
time series in this context. The basic idea behind the stochastic family of 
volatility forecasting methods is that volatility goes through phases in which 
it is at high levels, followed by periods in which it is at low levels (i.e., the 

## Page 122

102  Ins I de the Black Box
somewhat predictable phases of the volatility cycle), with occasional jumps 
(the somewhat random and unpredictable part). The most widely used such 
technique is called Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedas-
ticity (GARCH), which was proposed in 1986 in the Journal of Economet-
rics by the Danish econometrician Tim Bollerslev.
2 Other approaches to 
stochastic volatility modeling and variants of the original GARCH forecast 
abound. All these techniques basically share the notion that volatility goes 
through clustered periods of relative calm, followed by periods of swings, 
followed by a return to calm, and so forth. This can be seen in Exhibit 6.3 
as being a relatively useful way to describe market volatility. From 2000 
to 2003, the S&P 500 was rather volatile. This was followed by a period 
of calm from mid‐2003 to mid‐2007, and after that by another period of 
extreme volatility from mid‐2007 through 2008. Even during the relatively 
calm period, short, seemingly periodic bursts in volatility occurred. GARCH 
types of models do a reasonable job of forecasting volatility in this sort of 
pattern.
Indeed, there exist many other approaches to forecasting volatility, and 
they can be understood in much the same way that we evaluated strategies 
for forecasting price. They tend to make forecasts based on ideas of trend, 
reversion, or some fundamental model of volatility; they can be made over 
various time horizons; they can forecast either the volatility of a single in-
strument or the relative volatility of more than one instrument, and so forth.

GARCH forecasts, for example, are a way of understanding how a time 
series behaves. The “A ” in the acronym GARCH stands for Autoregressive, 
which is a statistical term that characterizes a mean reverting process. A 
negative value for autoregression implies that the time series exhibits trend-
ing behavior (which is also called autocorrelative). In this case, the time 
series relates to the volatility of an instrument.
e
xpected Correlation
 
The third input to the optimizer is the correlation ma-
trix. Correlation is at heart a measure of the similarity of the movements 
of two instruments, expressed in a number between –1 and +1. A +1 cor -
relation implies exact similarity, whereas a –1 correlation implies that the 
two instruments are exactly opposite, or anti‐correlated. A 0 correlation is 
perfect non‐correlation and implies that the two instruments are entirely 
dissimilar , but not opposite. An interesting fact about correlation is that it 
says nothing about the trend in the instruments over time. For example, im-
agine two companies in the same industry group, such as airline companies. 
If the first company is simply outcompeting the other and winning market 
share, the first will likely have a positive trendline, while the second may 
well have a negative trendline (assuming the overall market is roughly flat). 
Nevertheless, these two companies will likely have a high positive correla-
tion, because their returns are still driven heavily by the overall market, by 
their sector , and by their industry, not to mention the more specific market 
factors associated with being an airline company (e.g., the price of oil).
There are a number of problems with using standard correlation meas-
ures in quant trading, most of which we will address at various points later . 
Most relevant for the moment, the measurement of the relationships be-
tween two instruments can be very unstable over time. They can even be 
unreliable over long time periods. For example, imagine a portfolio with 
two investments: one in the S&P 500 and one in the Nikkei 225. Taking the 
data on both since January 1984, we can see that these two indices correlate 
at a level of 0.37 since inception. The range of correlations observed using 
weekly returns over any consecutive 365 calendar days (a rolling year) is 
shown in Exhibit 6.4. Please note that we choose to use weekly returns in 
this case, rather than daily returns, because of the time‐zone difference be-
tween the United States and Japan. In general, there is a one‐day lag between 
the movements that occur in Japan, with respect to the moves that occur 
in the United States. This can be handled either by using less frequent than 
daily returns (as in this example) or by lagging the Japanese returns by a day.
You can see that the level of correlation observed between the S&P 
500 and the Nikkei 225 depends quite a lot on exactly when it is measured. 
Indeed, this correlation reaches the lowest point in the sample (+0.01) in 
October 1989 and by mid‐2008 was at its highest point (+0.66). What’s 

## Page 124

104  Ins I de the Black Box
worse, the correlation between these indices went from +0.02 to +0.58, 
and then back to +0.01 all during the course of about four years, from 
November 1985 until October 1989. Even using a rolling five‐year window, 
the range is +0.21 to +0.57.
If the strategy specifies appropriate groupings of instruments, as in our 
earlier example of industry groups, the stability of the correlations over time 
improves. This specification can be made either in the definition of relative 
in a relative alpha strategy and/or in the specification of the risk model. So, 
for example, if the model groups together companies such as XOM and 
CVX, this can be seen as reasonable, because these two companies have 
much in common. Both have market capitalizations on the same general 
scale, both are oil companies, both are based in the United States and have 
global operations, and so on. Meanwhile, a comparison between CVX and 
Sun Microsystems (JA V A) might be less defensible based on fundamental 
factors, such as the fact that JA V A isn’t an oil company but is a much smaller 
capitalization company in the technology sector . Somewhat predictably, this 
theoretical difference in the comparability between these two pairs of stocks 
(XOM vs. CVX, CVX vs. JA V A) also bears out in the data, as shown in 
Exhibit 6.5.
As you can see, CVX and XOM correlate relatively well over the entire 
period of more than 20 years. The lowest correlation level observed between 
this pair is approximately 0.40, and the highest is 0.89. The correlation 
over the entire period is 0.70. Meanwhile, CVX and JA V A correlate poorly, 
at a level of only 0.14 over the whole sample, with a minimum two‐year

correlation of –0.14 and a maximum of 0.36. Furthermore, the correla-
tion between CVX and XOM changes more smoothly over time than that 
between CVX and JA V A. Though both pairs can be said to be somewhat 
unstable, it is quite clear that grouping CVX with XOM is less likely to be 
problematic than grouping CVX with JA V A. T o be clear , the instability of 
correlations among financial instruments is more or less a fact of the world. 
It is not the fault of optimizers, nor of correlation as a statistic, that this hap-
pens to be the case in the finance industry.
The main source of this instability is that the relationships between fi-
nancial instruments are often governed by a variety of dynamic forces. For 
example, if the stock market is experiencing a significant downdraft, it is 
probable that the correlation between CVX and JA V A will be temporarily 
higher than usual. If, on the other hand, there is uncertainty about oil sup-
ply, this may affect CVX but not JA V A, and correlation may be reduced 
temporarily. If either company has significant news, this can cause decou-
pling as well.

techniques. This section provides an overview of the most common of these 
approaches.
u
nconstrained 
o
ptimization
 
The most basic form of an optimizer is one that 
has no constraints; for example, it can suggest putting 100 percent of a port-
folio in a single instrument if it wants. Indeed, it is a quirk of unconstrained 
optimizers that they often do exactly that: propose a single‐instrument port-
folio, where all the money would be invested in the instrument with the 
highest risk‐adjusted return.
Constrained 
o
ptimization
 
To address this problem, quants figured out how 
to add constraints and penalties in the optimization process, which forces 
more “reasonable” solutions. Constraints can include position limits (e.g., 
not more than 3 percent of the portfolio can be allocated to a given posi -
tion) or limits on various groupings of instruments (e.g., not more than 
20 percent of the portfolio can be invested in any sector). An interesting 
conundrum for the quant, however , is that, if the unconstrained optimizer 
would tend to choose unacceptable solutions, to the extent that constraints 
are applied it can become the case that the constraints drive the portfolio 
construction more than the optimizer . For example, imagine a portfolio 
of 100 instruments, with the optimizer limited to allocating no more 
than 1.5 percent to any single position. The average position is naturally 
1 percent (1/100 of the portfolio). So, the very best positions (according to 
the alpha model) are only 1.5 times the average position, which is relatively 
close to equal‐weighted. This is fine, but it somewhat defeats the purpose 
of optimizing.
Another class of constraints for optimization involves the integration of 
risk models. Here, too, there are several ways to implement a constraint (as 
discussed in Chapter 4), including penalties and hard limits. If, for example, 
we simply want to eliminate sector risk, a simple way might be to modify 
the correlation matrix so that all stocks within a given sector are given high 
positive correlations. The optimizer would otherwise solve for the best so-
lution given this modified correlation structure. Alternatively, we could in-
troduce a penalty function that penalizes a small amount of sector risk at a 
low level (i.e., the expected return needed to overcome this penalty would 
be itself relatively small); but, as the level of sector risk increases to double 
the prior level, the expected return needed to justify this increase is substan-
tially larger than double the alpha required at the lower level of sector risk. 
In other words, the expected marginal reward must increase substantially 
faster than the expected marginal risk, and the larger the increase in risk, the 
faster the expected return must increase to make the optimizer accept the 
trade‐off and allow the increased risk exposure.

## Page 127

Portfolio Construction Models  107
Transaction costs, too, can be addressed in various ways. One can build 
an empirical model of every stock’s market impact function, and use this set 
of individual market impact models to feed into the optimizer . Alternatively, 
one could simply specify a market impact function that takes inputs such as 
volatility, (dollar) volume, and the order size, and have a generalized solu-
tion for a market impact model. These are but two of the many ways that 
quants can account for expected transaction costs as an input to a portfolio 
optimization.
The mathematics and programming that achieve optimization are de-
signed to account for the types of inputs mentioned above, iteratively solv-
ing for the trade‐off that maximizes the objective function (for example, 
the expected return versus the expected volatility) of a portfolio. The op-
timizer is trying to solve a lot of problems at once, potentially: maximize 
returns per unit of risk, accounting for correlation and volatility, while stay-
ing within various hard limits (e.g., maximum position size constraints), and 
while accounting for risk factor exposures and transaction costs. While it’s 
complicated, compared to many other aspects of a systematic trading strat-
egy, these are generally very well‐understood solutions, and there are many 
canned, off‐the‐shelf (including free, open source codebase) packages that 
compute these solutions relatively painlessly.
If we think back to Exhibit 6.2, visually, constraining an optimization 
involves cutting out regions of the surface that do not satisfy the condi-
tions. For example, imagine that we impose a market exposure constraint, 
such that the maximum difference between the bets on ABC and DEF is 20 
percent. In this case, most of the surface will be ignored by the optimizer , 
and only the parts of the surface that satisfy the maximum exposure con-
straint are searched. This is illustrated in Exhibit 6.6. As you can see by com-
paring this exhibit to Exhibit 6.2, the excluded areas of search due to the 
constraint on net exposure are the flat, somewhat triangular “wings” along 
the plane at a 0 Sharpe Ratio. Note that, since we are limiting the region for 
the optimizer to search through, it is possible to add so many constraints 
that there is no solution.
It is also worth recognizing that our example is extremely oversimpli-
fied. We have a portfolio of only two assets, high correlation, and one sim-
ple constraint. In a more realistic scenario, the surface is unlikely to be so 
simple‐looking, with a clear trend toward a single peak. In a more complex 
case, there may be many peaks scattered around various regions of the over-
all space. The algorithm used to seek the optimal outcome must be designed 
with a specific trade‐off in mind, namely between thoroughness and speed. 
A faster , less thorough optimization algorithm might find a local peak in 
the curve and stop looking, even though somewhere else in the universe 
of possible portfolios, there is an even better portfolio to consider . A more

thorough search algorithm might find that globally optimal solution, but its 
search might take far too long to be practicable.

Fischer Black, of Black‐Scholes fame, and Bob 
Litterman, of Goldman Sachs, in 1990 produced a new optimization meth-
od that was first introduced in an internal memo at Goldman but was later 
published in 1992 in the Financial Analysts Journal.
3 Their Black‐Litter-
man optimizer addresses some of the problems associated with errors in the 
measurement of inputs to an optimizer . Most important, they proposed a 
method of blending an investor’s expectations with a degree of confidence 
about those expectations, and these with the historical precedent evident 
in the data. For example, imagine that CVX and XOM correlate at 0.7 
historically, but going forward, a trader’s alpha model forecasts that XOM 
will rally while CVX will fall. In this case, the correlation between CVX 
and XOM over the period being forecast may be quite low, perhaps even 
negative, despite the evidence from history. Black‐Litterman provided a way 
to adjust historically observed correlation levels by utilizing the investor’s 
forecasts of return for the various instruments in question. Furthermore, to 
the extent that the investor has greater confidence in some forecasts and less

in others, this fact can be incorporated. If the investor forecasts significant 
divergence between instruments that historically have correlated at a high 
level but has a low level of confidence in the forecast, something much closer 
to the historical level of correlation is used. T o the extent that the investor 
has greater confidence, the forecast returns play a more important role in 
determining the correlation coefficient utilized by the Black‐Litterman op-
timizer . Some quants prefer this method of optimization because it allows 
for a more holistic approach to combining the alpha model with the other 
inputs to optimization.

Another kind of opti -
mizer that bears mentioning is described in Grinold and Kahn’s seminal Ac-
tive Portfolio Management.4 This kind of portfolio optimization technique is 
directly aimed at building a portfolio of signals, whereas most optimizers try 
to size positions. The method of optimizing proposed by Grinold and Kahn is 
fairly widely used. The idea of this approach is to build factor portfolios, each 
of which is usually rule‐based (in fact, very often equal‐weighted or equal 
risk–weighted) portfolios based on a single type of alpha forecast. So, for ex-
ample, one could imagine building a momentum portfolio, a value portfolio, 
and a growth portfolio. Each of these portfolios is in turn simulated histori-
cally , as though it were making stock picks through the past. For instance, the 
value factor’s portfolio would look back at the historical data and simulate 
the results it would have achieved by buying undervalued instruments and 
shorting overvalued instruments through this historical sample, as though it 
were reliving the past. In this way , a time series of the returns of these simu-
lated factor portfolios is generated. These simulated factor portfolio returns 
are then treated as the instruments of a portfolio by the optimizer .
One benefit of this approach is that the number of factor portfolios is 
typically much more manageable, usually not more than about 20, corre-
sponding to the number of individual factors in the alpha model. What is 
therefore being optimized is not a portfolio of thousands of instruments but 
rather the mixing of a handful of factor portfolios. This is certainly an easier 
hurdle to clear in terms of the amount of data needed. Factor portfolio opti-
mization allows for the inclusion of the risk model, transaction cost model, 
portfolio size, and risk target as inputs, in much the same way as described 
for other optimizers.
Given the weight of each model, we ultimately need to ascertain the 
weight of each position. The way that each position’s weight is computed in 
this approach is perhaps easiest to understand by example. Imagine we have 
two alpha factors, both of which yield only a directional forecast (i.e., +1 for a 
buy signal or –1 for a sell signal). We have 100 stocks in the factor portfolios, 
which are equally weighted for simplicity’s sake. This means that each stock

110  Ins I de the Black Box
is 1 percent of each factor portfolio. Let’s assume that the factor optimization 
procedure dictated that we should have a 60 percent weight on the first factor 
portfolio and a 40 percent weight on the second. The allocation to any stock 
in this example is 1 percent (the weight of each name in each factor portfolio) 
times the signal given by that factor (i.e., long or short) times the weight of 
each factor portfolio. Let’s say that the first alpha factor’s forecast for a given 
company is +1, and the second is –1. So the total allocation to the company 
is [(1%) * (+1) * (60%)] + [(1%) * (–1) * (40%)] = +0.2%, meaning that we 
would be long 0.2 percent of our portfolio in this company .

In Efficient Asset Management, Richard Michaud pro-
posed yet another approach to portfolio construction models.5 Rather than 
proposing a new type of optimization, however , Michaud sought to improve 
the inputs to optimization. His Resampled Efficiency technique may address 
oversensitivity to estimation error . Michaud argues that this is in fact the 
single greatest problem with optimizers. Earlier , we gave the example of 
the instability of the correlation between the S&P 500 and the Nikkei 225. 
This implied that, if we used the past to set expectations for the future—in 
other words, to estimate the correlation between these two instruments go-
ing forward—we are reasonably likely to have the wrong estimate at any 
given time, relative to the actual correlation that will be observed in the 
future. A quant will have such estimation errors in the alpha forecasts, in the 
volatility forecasts, and in the correlation estimates. It turns out that mean 
variance optimizers are extremely sensitive to these kinds of errors in that 
even small differences in expectations lead to large changes in the recom-
mended portfolios.
Michaud proposes to resample the data using a technique called Monte 
Carlo simulation to reduce the estimation error inherent in the inputs to the 
optimizer . A Monte Carlo simulation reorders the actually observed results 
many times, thereby creating a large number of time series all based on the 
same underlying observations. For example, imagine we are testing a trend‐
following strategy that is based on the closing prices of the S&P 500 from 
1982 through 2008. But now we want to get a sense of how robust the strate-
gy might be if the future doesn’t look exactly like the past. So, we can take the 
return distribution of the S&P 500, which tells us how often the S&P gains or 
loses various amounts, and use it to create a large number of alternate histo-
ries for the index. By reshuffling the returns in this way , we have less depend-
ence on the past looking just like the future, because we now have thousands 
of “pasts” over which to test our strategy . Interestingly , the average return and 
the volatility of returns will remain the same across all these alternate histories 
because they are based on the same underlying return distribution. But now 
we can see how often our strategy performs well or poorly across all these 

## Page 131

Portfolio Construction Models  111
hypothetical scenarios and therefore how likely it is to work well or poorly in 
a future that might not resemble the past precisely . This technique is thought 
to produce more robust predictions than are possible from simply using only 
the actual sequence of returns the instrument exhibited, in that the researcher 
is capturing more aspects of the behavior of the instrument. It is this intuition 
that is at the heart of Monte Carlo simulations.
A word of warning regarding such resampling techniques, however: 
Re‐using a historical distribution is only really useful if you have sufficient 
confidence that the sample in the historical distribution is a fair representa-
tion of the whole population. For example, if you were to use the S&P’s 
daily returns from 1988 through 2006, you might believe you had a very 
good data sample: approximately 19 years of daily returns. However , you 
would be missing many of the largest negative observations, because both 
the 1987 crash and the 2007–2008 bear market would be missing. Specifi-
cally, using the 19‐year sample, you’d have only nine days in your sample 
during which the S&P declined by more than 4 percent, and only 11 days 
where the S&P rose by more than 4 percent. By including those extra three 
years of data, you would see an extra 19 days on which the S&P declined 
by more than 4 percent (including one day larger than –20%), as well as 16 
extra days on which the S&P rose by more than 4 percent (including one 
day of almost +12%).

As a final note on the types of optimiz-
ers, we turn our attention briefly to data‐mining approaches applied to port-
folio construction models. Some quants use machine learning techniques, 
such as supervised learning or genetic algorithms, to help with the problem 
of optimization. The argument in favor of machine learning techniques in 
portfolio construction is that mean variance optimization is a form of data 
mining in that it involves searching many possible portfolios and attempt-
ing to find the ones that exhibited the best characteristics, as specified by the 
objective function of the optimizer . But the field of machine learning aims 
to do much the same thing, and it is a field that has received more rigorous 
scientific attention in a wide variety of disciplines than portfolio optimiza-
tion, which is almost exclusively a financial topic. As such, there may be 
good arguments for considering machine learning approaches to finding the 
optimal portfolio, especially due to the quality of those algorithms relative 
to the mean variance optimization technique.
f inal Thoughts on o ptimization
One interesting byproduct of portfolio optimization is that there are in-
stances in which an instrument that is forecast to have a positive return 

## Page 132

112  Ins I de the Black Box
in the future by the alpha model might end up as a short position in the 
final portfolio (or vice versa). How can this happen? Imagine we are trad-
ing a group of equities in the United States and that one of the constraints 
imposed on the optimization by the risk model is that the portfolio must 
be neutral to each industry group. In other words, for every dollar of long 
positions within, say, the software industry, we must have a corresponding 
dollar of short positions within the same industry (to create a zero net posi-
tion in the software industry). But what if we have positive return expecta-
tions for every stock in the software industry? The optimizer would likely 
be long those software companies with the highest positive return expecta-
tions and short those software companies with the lowest positive return 
expectations.
Certainly, among sophisticated quants that use optimizers to build their 
portfolios, the most simplistic optimization techniques (particularly uncon-
strained) are in the minority. Still, though the intuition behind optimization 
is sound, the technique itself is perhaps the most properly labeled black 
box part of the quant trading system. The output is sometimes confusing 
relative to the inputs because of the complexity of the interactions among 
an alpha model, a risk model, and a transaction cost model, along with 
the constraints of size and desired risk level. Compounding the complexity, 
we have to consider the interaction among various kinds of alpha factors 
within the alpha model. That said, it is highly likely that the larger positions 
in the portfolio are those with the strongest expected returns. The strange 
behavior described here—having a position in the opposite direction as the 
alpha model’s forecast—is observable mainly with the smaller positions in 
the portfolio because it is among these that the expected returns can be over-
come by transaction cost or risk management considerations.
This last phenomenon is sometimes known as the substitution effect. If 
we have a higher forecasted return for ABC than we do for DEF , it might 
be expected that our portfolio should reflect this. However , if ABC is also 
expected to be dramatically more expensive to trade, and if ABC and DEF 
are reasonably correlated, the optimizer might well choose to invest in DEF 
instead of ABC.

Regardless of the type of portfolio construction approach used, the out-
put of the quantitative portfolio construction model is a targeted portfolio: 
the desirable individual positions and the targeted sizes of each. This target 
portfolio is compared to the current portfolio, and the differences are the 
trades that need to be done. In the case that a brand‐new portfolio is being 

## Page 133

Portfolio Construction Models  113
built from scratch, all the positions recommended by the portfolio construc-
tion model will need to be executed. If, instead, the quant is rerunning the 
portfolio construction model as he would do periodically in the normal 
course of business, he would need to do only the incremental trades that 
close the gap between the newly recommended portfolio and the existing 
portfolio he holds.
h o W  Quan T s Choose a p or T folio Cons T ru CT ion Model
I have observed that the significant majority of quants using rule‐based 
allocation systems seem to take an “intrinsic” alpha approach (i.e., they 
forecast individual instruments rather than forecasting instruments rela-
tive to each other). Most, but not all, of these are actually futures traders. 
Meanwhile, quants utilizing optimizers tend to be focused on a “relative” 
alpha approach, most typically found among equity market neutral strate-
gies. There is no obvious reason for the difference in the preferred portfolio 
construction approach for relative and intrinsic traders. However , it is likely 
that quants that use relative alpha strategies already believe implicitly in the 
stability of the relationships among their instruments. After all, in a relative 
alpha paradigm, the forecast for a given instrument is as much a function 
of that instrument’s behavior as it is about the behavior of the instruments 
to which the first is being compared. If these relationships are unstable, the 
strategy is doomed to start with, because its first premise is that certain com-
parisons can be made reliably. If the relationships are stable, however , it is 
entirely logical and consistent that the quant can rely on them for portfolio 
construction as well.
Meanwhile, if a quant takes an intrinsic alpha approach, he is making 
an implicit statement that his portfolio is largely made up of a series of inde-
pendent bets, so relying on a correlation matrix (one of the key inputs to the 
optimizer) might not be very useful. Instead, this kind of quant would focus 
efforts more directly on risk limits and alpha forecasts subject to transac-
tion costs. This more direct approach to portfolio construction is usually 
best implemented with a rule‐based model. It is interesting to note that the 
kind of alpha model a quant builds is likely to impact the choice of portfolio 
construction model that makes the most sense to use.
s u MM ary
We have described the two major families of portfolio construction mod-
els. Rule‐based models take a heuristic approach, whereas portfolio opti-

## Page 134

114  Ins I de the Black Box
mizers utilize logic rooted in modern portfolio theory. Within each family 
are numerous techniques and, along with these, numerous challenges. How 
does the practitioner taking a rule‐based approach justify the arbitrariness 
of the rules he chooses? How does the practitioner utilizing optimization 
address the myriad issues associated with estimating volatility and correla-
tion? In choosing the “correct” portfolio construction technique, the quant 
must judge the problems and advantages of each, and determine which is 
most suitable, given the type of alpha, risk, and transaction cost models  
being used.
All of these techniques share one common thread, however: They are 
taking the expected returns (from the alpha model’s forecasts) and trans-
forming those into a portfolio. This transformation can be extremely simple 
or very complex, and the choice is determined by the approach that the 
quant researcher takes to the problem. However , all of these approaches 
are attempting to maximize the goodness of the outcome. What determines 
goodness is also entirely up to the researcher . For example, some seek to 
maximize the Sharpe ratio, others seek to maximize the ratio of return to 
maximum peak‐to‐valley drawdown, and still others might seek to maxi-
mize the expected return without consideration given to the level of risk. 
In each case, the researcher can choose also whether and what to constrain 
as far as risk exposures. Still, the goal is to maximize the goodness of the 
outcome, subject to any relevant constraints.
We have completed the penultimate stop on the trip through the inside 
of the black box, as seen on our road map (Exhibit 6.7). Next we will see 
how quants actually implement the portfolios that they derived using their 
portfolio construction models.

Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high 
intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution.
—William A. Foster
S
o far in our tour through the black box, we have seen how quants deter-
mine what portfolio they want to own. Quants build alpha models, risk 
models, and transaction cost models. These modules are fed into a portfolio 
construction model, which determines a target portfolio. But having a target 
portfolio on a piece of paper or computer screen is considerably different 
from actually owning that portfolio. The final part of the black box itself 
is to implement the portfolio decisions made by the portfolio construction 
model, which is accomplished by executing the desired trades.
There are two basic ways to execute a trade: either electronically or 
through a human intermediary (e.g., a broker). Most quants elect to utilize 
the electronic method, because the number of transactions is frequently so 
large that it would be unreasonable and unnecessary to expect people to 
succeed at it. Electronic execution is accomplished through direct market 
access (DMA), which allows traders to utilize the infrastructure and ex-
change connectivity of their brokerage firms to trade directly on electronic 
markets such as ECNs. For ease, I will refer to any type of liquidity pool—
whether ECN, exchange, or otherwise—as an exchange, unless a specific 
point needs to be made about a particular type of market center .
Several points bear clarification. First, DMA is available to any trader , 
whether quant or discretionary, and in fact, many discretionary traders also 
utilize DMA platforms offered by their brokers to execute trades. Trades 
submitted via DMA can still be done manually if so desired, but they are 
manually entered into computer software, which then directly communi-
cates with the electronic exchanges.

In the past, traders would call their brokers, who would “work” orders, 
which meant the latter trying to pick the best times, sizes, and prices, or 
occasionally contacting other counterparties to negotiate a better price on 
a larger block trade. Now, particularly on electronic exchanges, execution 
algorithms are far more commonly responsible for working orders. Execu-
tion algorithms contain the logic used to get an order completed, including 
instructions about how to slice up an order into smaller pieces (to minimize 
market impact), or how to respond to various kinds of changes in the limit 
order book and price behavior .
One can acquire execution algorithms in one of three ways: build them, 
use the broker’s, or use a third‐party software vendor’s. This chapter will, in 
part, detail the kinds of things execution algorithms are designed to handle. 
We will then discuss more recent developments related to the infrastructure 
quants utilize to execute trades. A more thorough coverage of infrastruc-
ture‐ and execution‐related issues, particular to latency‐sensitive execution 
and trading strategies (including high‐frequency trading) will be addressed 
in Part Four of this book.
Though most orders executed by quants are algorithmic, traders occa-
sionally utilize a service most brokerages offer , namely, portfolio bidding. I 
describe this idea only briefly, since it is not a particularly quantitative way 
to execute trades. In a portfolio bid, a blind portfolio that the trader wants 
to transact is described by its characteristics in terms such as the valuation 
ratios of the longs and shorts, the sector breakdown, market capitalizations, 
and the like. Based on these characteristics, brokers quote a fee, usually in 
terms of the number of basis points (100 basis points = 1 percent) of the 
gross market value of the portfolio being traded. In exchange for this cost, 
a guaranteed price is given to do the transaction. The quant using this ar -
rangement, in other words, is buying certainty of the prices of his trades 
and in exchange is paying the broker for providing that certainty. Once 
an agreement is reached between the broker and the quant, he receives the 
transactions from the broker at the pre‐agreed price, and the broker receives 
his fee for the service and assumes the risk of trading out of the portfolio 
at future market prices, which may be better or worse than the prices they 
have guaranteed. Human execution of quant portfolios often looks like a 
portfolio bid rather than a series of individual orders being worked.
Generally, the workflow for a quant trader is not materially different 
now from what it was in the days that preceded automated execution. Some 
traders preferred to more actively work their own orders, and many others 
would outsource order working to brokers. Some firms would outsource 
their executions to third‐party execution services firms, who would inter -
face with brokers on behalf of the trader . T oday, while some firms continue 
to employ human traders, more often quant trading firms execute orders 

## Page 139

Execution 119
through algorithms. As before, some of these firms have their own order 
working algorithms, while others utilize those offered by their broker or 
other service providers. In most cases, they still send their orders to a broker 
for execution. As such, the vast majority of volumes on various exchanges 
around the developed world are executed by algorithms on behalf of clients. 
And, just as before, these volumes are a form of currency for the trading 
firms that drive them. They bring valuable commission dollars to brokers, 
and in exchange for a trader bringing his business to a particular broker , the 
broker may be willing to offer research, data, or capital‐raising assistance, 
among other services.

Order execution algorithms determine the way in which systematic execu-
tion of a portfolio is actually done. We can examine the kinds of decisions 
the algorithms must make in real time in much the same framework in 
which we’d think about how discretionary traders implement their orders. 
The kinds of considerations are the same in both cases, and as has been 
the theme throughout this book, we find that quants differ here from their 
discretionary counterparts principally in the mechanics and not so much in 
the ideas. The principal goal of execution algorithms, and the function of 
most execution desks in general, is to minimize the cost of trading into and 
out of positions.
The primary goals of an order execution algorithm are to get the 
desired amount of a trade done as completely as possible and as cheaply 
as possible. Each of these goals is equally interesting and important. Com -
pleteness is important because the best portfolio is selected by the port -
folio construction model, and if those trades are not implemented, then a 
different portfolio is owned from what was intended. Cheapness is impor -
tant for all the reasons we described in Chapter 5: In short, if you can save 
money every time you make a trade, you will be better off. An obvious cor-
ollary is that the more you trade, the more important it is to save money 
on each trade. This statement, simple and obvious as it is, has important 
implications for how a rational quant trader goes about building an execu -
tion capability. For strategies that require infrequent execution, it may be 
reasonably viewed as overkill to build a very expensive high‐speed trading 
infrastructure. After all, the savings of being high speed versus standard 
speed are very small, so they are only worth pursuing if they can be made 
up for in frequency.
Cheapness has several facets, including market impact and slippage, as 
discussed in Chapter 5. However , one driver of both impact and slippage 

## Page 140

120  Ins I de the Black Box
is what is known as a footprint, which refers to a detectable pattern of 
behavior by a market participant (think of footprints in the same way a 
tracker does, when hunting some animal in a forest). If an order execution 
algorithm leaves an obvious footprint, its activities become predictable to 
other market participants, and these other participants may well react in 
such a way as to increase the market impact and slippage incurred by such 
an algorithm.
An important question is how to measure the efficacy of an execution 
algorithm. There are a few important concepts worth mentioning here. First 
is the notion of the mid‐market, which is the average of the best bid and the 
best offer (which is, by definition, the midpoint between those two levels) 
on an instrument. This is the most standard way to judge the fair price of a 
given transaction. If, for example, one is able to buy at the best bid, which 
is obviously below the then‐current mid‐market, that particular transaction 
is considered to have been executed at a favorable price (just as a sale at the 
then‐current best offer might be).
Second, the notion of the volume‐weighted average price (VW AP , for 
short) is the most standard benchmark for judging the quality of an execu-
tion algorithm over multiple trades (either within a day or over multiple 
days). The idea here is that the VW AP may give a fair sense of how the day’s 
volumes were priced. Since this is the weighted average price at which the 
day’s trading was transacted, it is a reasonable start at thinking about the 
efficacy of an algorithm. The trouble is that some investors may be fooled 
by looking at VW AP . If a buyer of stock executes huge volumes during some 
day, his volumes will most likely increase the price of that stock, and the 
VW AP . As such, his own activities impact the benchmark against which his 
execution algorithm is measured, making the interpretation of this bench-
mark tricky.
The major considerations that go into the making of an order working 
algorithm are as follows: whether to be aggressive or passive; what type of 
order to utilize; how to determine the ideal order size; and where to send it. 
We will briefly address each of these issues.
a ggressive versus p assive
There are two general approaches to execution: aggressive and passive. 
Aggressive orders (most often in the form of market orders) are submitted to 
the marketplace and are generally unconditional. They can be filled in pieces 
or in full at whatever price prevails at the market at the time the order’s turn 
to be executed arrives (within reasonable boundaries, and so long as there is 
a bid or offer resting in the order book to take the other side of the market 
order). In contrast, passive orders (a subset of all limit orders) allow the 

## Page 141

Execution 121
trader to control the worst price at which he is willing to transact, but the 
trader must accept that his order might not get executed at all or that only 
a part of it might be executed. There is also a significant problem of adverse 
selection, which we will describe in further detail in Chapter 14.
The collection of all available bids and offers (all of which are pas-
sive orders) for a given security is known as the limit order book, which 
can be thought of as a queue of limit orders to buy and sell. In electronic 
markets, each order that is placed on the exchange is prioritized. Highest 
priority is given to orders at the best prices (the best bids for buy orders 
and the best offers for sell orders), whereas lower priority is given to those 
who are bidding or offering worse prices. For two traders offering the same 
price, traders who show their orders are given higher priority (by most ex-
changes) than those who hide them (more on this shortly), and for traders 
who are still tied, the tiebreaker is, not surprisingly, (most often) which one  
came first.
For some markets, rather than time priority, all orders at a given price 
are given equal priority, but they are filled according to a pro rata alloca-
tion of any active order . For example, imagine there are two bids on some 
instrument at $100.00 (which we will assume is the best bid price), one for 
100 units and another for 900 units. Now imagine that an active order to 
sell 100 units comes into the market. The order would be filled at $100.00, 
and the passive orders would be allocated as follows: 10 units allocated to 
the 100 unit order , leaving 90 units remaining on the bid at $100.00, and 
90 units allocated to the 900 unit order , leaving 810 units remaining at the 
bid price. Special considerations apply to these markets, namely a trade‐off 
between oversizing and overtrading.
Oversizing refers to one technique that a trader might consider using to 
deal with pro rata markets. Since an active trade is allocated to the various 
relevant limit orders resting in the order book, proportionately to the size 
of a given limit order versus the other orders resting in the book at the same 
price, some traders intentionally oversize their limit orders. This will allow 
that order to get a larger share of any active order that interacts with the 
order book. However , there is also the risk that the order is so large that it 
causes the position to be bigger than the passive trader desired.
On the other hand, if the trader sizes his orders smaller , he must deal 
with placing and canceling large numbers of orders, which is known as 
overtrading. Imagine some trader wishes to passively buy 100 units of some 
instrument, and that at the time an active order to sell 100 units comes in, 
there is another trader’s 900 unit order already in the limit order book. He 
will only receive a 10 unit fill. Depending on the volume of orders that join 
his limit order price as he awaits a complete fulfillment of his desired size, 
he runs the risk of having a very large amount of selling need to take place 

## Page 142

122  Ins I de the Black Box
before his 100 units is finally filled. And, as we will see in more detail in 
Chapter 14, this means that he runs a severe risk of experiencing adverse 
selection
2 (i.e., it is often bad news when the fills actually take place, because 
the price is likely to move against you in the short term by the time that 
happens). This in turn means that the trader must be quick to cancel orders 
and replace them as he competes with larger orders. Without high cancella-
tion rates in this type of market, there would be a vicious cycle of oversizing 
that theoretically might never end. But as traders cancel, an oversized order 
might need to cancel as well, because it now is vulnerable to being filled at 
a larger size than the trader intended.
Regardless, the first kind of decision an execution algorithm must 
make is how passive or aggressive to be. Passivity and aggression rep -
resent how immediately a trader wants to do a trade. Market orders are 
considered aggressive, because the trader is saying to the market that he 
just wants his order filled immediately, at whatever the prevailing market 
will bear . As such, a market order to buy is likely to pay at least the offer , 
whereas a market order to sell is likely to receive, at most, the current best 
bid. If the order size is larger than the amount available at the current best 
bid or offer (whichever applies), the transaction will take out multiple 
bids or offers at increasingly adverse prices. Paying this kind of cost to 
transact might be worthwhile if the trader really wants the trade done 
immediately.
Limit orders can be placed at differing levels of aggressiveness as well. 
For example, a limit order to buy at the current best offer is an aggressive 
order because it crosses the spread and removes the best offer from the order 
book (this is also known as lifting the offer). By contrast, a limit order to 
buy at or below the current best bid is passive because the trader is effec-
tively saying he is fine with the lower probability of being executed, but if 
he does execute, he is at least only paying the price he’s specified. In addition 
to accepting this uncertainty, the passive order is further subject to a serious 
problem known as adverse selection. A trader who is willing to cross the 
bid‐offer spread by placing an active order may well have information that 
the trade he is conducting is actually worth it paying the bid‐offer spread 
to get put on right away. T o complicate matters further , as we discussed in 
the discussion of transaction cost models, many exchanges actually pay pro-
viders of liquidity for placing passive orders while they charge traders for 
using liquidity being provided. T o phrase it another way, orders that cross 
the spread (orders to buy that are executed at the offer , or orders to sell that 
are executed at the bid) are using, or “taking,” liquidity in that each share 
or contract executed in this manner is taking out a passive order that’s been 
placed by another trader , which reduces the liquidity available for other 
participants.

## Page 143

Execution 123
The practice of paying for liquidity provision sweetens the deal for a 
passive order , but only if the order is actually executed. Not only does the 
passive trader get a better transaction price, but he also receives a commis-
sion rebate from the exchange (typically on the order of two‐tenths of a cent 
per share). But again, the trade‐off is a reduction in certainty of being filled 
and suffering from potential adverse selection. It is worth noting that some 
exchanges do the opposite: charge providers of liquidity while paying takers 
of liquidity. Thus, the liquidity provision (or taking) rebate (or fee) factors 
into the decision of how passive or aggressive to be. This also factors into 
answering the question of where to route an order , which is a topic we will 
cover further in “Where to Send an Order . ”
It is generally true that alpha strategies that are based on a concept of 
momentum will be paired with execution strategies that are more aggres-
sive, because the market can tend to run away from the trader if he is not 
aggressive. It is also generally the case that mean reversion strategies utilize 
more passive execution strategies because they are taking the risk that the 
prevailing trend persists, and at least by executing at a better price, this miti-
gates the downside risk of standing in front of the steamroller .
Another factor driving the use of passive or aggressive execution strate-
gies is the strength of the signal and the model’s confidence level in the sig-
nal. A stronger , more certain signal probably will be executed with greater 
aggressiveness than a weaker or less certain signal. This idea is easily dem-
onstrated by extreme examples. If you had inside information that a stock 
was going to double in the next day because some other company was set 
to announce an acquisition of the stock in question at a large premium, and 
if trading on inside information was legal (which it, of course, is not), you 
should be perfectly happy to pay a lot of money to the marketplace to fill a 
large order to buy this stock. It would be illogical to fret over a few pennies 
per share when many dollars are the upside. On the other hand, if you have 
no view on a stock but were being asked what you’d be willing to pay for it 
by someone who wants to sell it, you are likely to offer a low enough price 
that there is some margin of safety.
A fairly common middle ground is to put out limit orders somewhere 
between the best current bid and offer (this is only feasible if the spread 
between the best bid and offer is larger than the minimum tick size). This 
way, the trader jumps to the front of the queue for executions, and though 
he pays a bit more than he would have to if he simply waited for his order 
to get executed passively, the limit order caps the amount by which he is 
worse off. At the same time, he has a higher probability of execution than 
he would if he simply added his order to the current best bid or offer . 
Finally, he is less likely to suffer from adverse selection in this case. In trad-
ing parlance, adding an order to the best bid or offer is known as joining 

## Page 144

124  Ins I de the Black Box
it; placing an order that constitutes a new best bid or offer is known as 
improving.
As data have been collected and researched by quants on the limit or -
der book, there has been an increase in sophistication of order execution 
algorithms to adjust passiveness or aggression based on various changes 
in the “shape” of the limit order book. This is an example of factoring in a 
so‐called micro price or fair value for an instrument. The most conventional 
ways to quote the price of an instrument are either to state its last traded 
price or its best bid and offer prices. But the last traded price only tells you 
what someone else just did, not what you can do now, making it of limited 
use for trading purposes. The best bid and offer are clearly useful, but what 
if the best bid has 10,000 units quoted, while the best offer has only 1 unit 
quoted? This clearly implies that the bid price is more relevant than the offer 
price. As such, many algorithms account for such imbalances by computing 
a fair price that reflects things like the imbalance between bids and offers in 
the limit order book.
T o summarize, the first characteristic of an order execution algorithm is 
its level of aggressiveness, and this can be thought of as a spectrum. At the 
most aggressive end of the spectrum are market orders; at the least aggres-
sive end of the spectrum are limit orders with prices that are far away from 
the current market. The level of aggressiveness is usually a function of the 
type of strategy being employed and depends on the strength of the signal, 
the system’s confidence in that signal, and sometimes also on considerations 
from the order book, such as a micro price.
Other Order t ypes
Given the plethora of exchanges and their rules, it would not be fruitful to 
attempt to cover every kind of order possible in this book. This is especially 
true because new order types are frequently being created by exchanges, and 
other order types are retired. However , it is worth understanding some of 
the types common in some of the largest and most active markets. We will 
outline several such order types in this section.
Hidden orders are a way to mask one’s limit orders from the market, at 
the cost of losing priority versus visible orders at the same price. The goal 
here is to hide one’s hand in terms of buy/sell intentions from other mar -
ket players while still being able to trade. As discussed, any time a trader 
puts into the queue a visible order—that is, an order that he has allowed 
the rest of the market to see—he gives away a bit of information. If many 
units are already being bought, and yet another trader submits another order 
to buy , you can imagine a scenario where the price goes up quickly , caus -
ing the transaction to cost a significant amount more. In other words, the 

## Page 145

Execution 125
marketplace has a broad‐based sense of market impact, based on the total 
imbalance between the buyers and sellers at the moment (this relates back to 
what we discussed regarding the micro‐price in the previous section). Placing 
a hidden order provides no information to the market, which helps reduce 
the market’s perception of imbalances. However , it also reduces the priority 
of the trade in the queue, leading to a lower probability of execution.
One algorithmic trading technique that utilizes hidden orders is known 
as iceberging, which takes a single large order and chops it into many small-
er orders, most of which are posted to the order book as hidden orders. In 
this way, the bulk of the order is hidden from other traders, just as only the 
tip of an iceberg is visible above sea level. It is worth noting that not all ex-
changes allow hidden orders.
In addition, several versions of market and limit orders, such as 
market‐on‐close orders or stop‐limit orders, exist. Market‐on‐close orders 
instruct the broker to release the order as a market order during the closing 
auction for that day. Stop limit orders  instruct the broker to enter a limit 
order at a predetermined price, but to wait until the instrument trades at 
that price before entering the order . There are also modifiers to orders, 
such as fill or kill, all or none, and good till canceled. A fill‐or‐kill order  is a 
limit order in which all the shares for the order must be filled immediately 
or the order is automatically canceled. An all‐or‐none order  is like a fill‐
or‐kill order without the cancellation feature, so if an order is not immedi -
ately completed in its full size, it remains untouched. A good‐till‐canceled 
order is a limit order that is not automatically canceled at the end of the 
day but remains in effect for days or weeks, until explicitly canceled by 
the trader .
Depending on the market and asset class, there are many other kinds 
of orders. Moreover , order types are regularly introduced and retired based 
on customer demands and requests. In the process of executing orders, the 
quant must determine the kind of orders that will be used in various circum-
stances. The more execution‐intensive a strategy is, the more it matters for a 
given quant to stay abreast of the latest order types available, and how the 
various exchanges’ rules work.
One type of order deserves special discussion. Intermarket sweep orders 
(ISOs) exist in U.S. equities because of a flaw in the Regulation National 
Market System (NMS). Reg NMS includes a ban on so‐called locked mar -
kets. A market is said to be locked when the best bid for a given ticker 
is equal to the best offer on that same ticker , but where these two orders 
do not interact with each other . Theoretically, you might expect that if a 
buyer is willing to buy shares at $100.00, and a seller is willing to sell the 
same shares for $100.00, those two traders’ orders would interact, and both 
trades would be filled. However , because of technological weaknesses in 

## Page 146

126  Ins I de the Black Box
the way that the order book is updated by exchanges after a trade has been 
completed, a market can sometimes look “locked” when it is not.3
For example, imagine that a trader enters a limit order to buy 5,000 
shares of some stock (we’ll call it WXYZ) at $100.00, which happens 
to be the best offered price at that moment. Further , the best bid at the 
time is $99.99. There are only 3,000 shares offered at $100.00. What 
you would think should happen is that the 5,000 share order interacts 
partially with the 3,000 share order , and that the remaining bid of 2,000 
shares of WXYZ at $100.00 would go into the limit order book as the 
new best bid (because it is a bid to buy WXYZ at a higher price than the 
former best bid of $99.99). However , because a piece of software that Reg 
NMS requires exchanges to use to communicate with one another regard -
ing the aggregated limit order book is slow, the 3,000 share offer will not 
disappear immediately from the consolidated book.
4 And, because of the 
ban on locked markets, the remaining 2,000 share bid at $100.00 will not 
be allowed to be posted to the limit order book until after this delay has 
been overcome.
The problem is that any firm with direct data feeds from each exchange 
in the consolidated book experiences no such delay in seeing the best of-
fer being taken out of the order book. Furthermore, having noticed that 
there was a large buy order , and they can come in and directly post a bid 
at $100.00, anticipating that the price of WXYZ is set to rise. Then, once 
the Reg NMS feed finally allows the original trader’s 2,000-share bid at 
$100.00 to be posted, this order will be lower in priority than the second 
trader’s bid, even though the 2,000-share order actually happened first. We 
discuss in more detail in Chapter 14 why this is a problem, but for now, let 
it suffice to say that it is extremely problematic to be forced to wait to enter 
an order artificially. T o avoid this problem, very sophisticated traders can be 
granted the right to use ISOs to execute their trades.
Broker‐dealers have the right to recognize a given client’s ability to be 
compliant with Reg NMS directly, without the trader having to use the pub-
licly available consolidated limit order book. Instead, these traders have di-
rect feeds from each exchange and build the same limit order book faster 
than the official one is made. They perform their own compliance checks, 
and if their brokers believe this is true, then they are allowed to use the ISO 
flag on their orders, which allows them to post the order correctly. In our 
earlier example, the trader would have been able to hit the offer of $100.00 
on 3,000 shares and immediately be the highest priority, best bid for 2,000 
shares at $100.00.
ISOs exist solely because of the ban on locked markets within Reg 
NMS, coupled with the slow technology that is used by exchanges to remain 
compliant with NMS. This is a topic we will revisit in Chapter 16.

l
arge Order versus Small Order
Whether for market orders or for limit orders, the quant has to determine 
how much of a total order to send at once. Recall from our discussion of 
transaction cost models that a large order costs disproportionately more to 
execute than a small order because demand for liquidity starts eating into 
more and more expensive supplies of liquidity. As such, a common tech-
nique for automated execution involves taking a large transaction for , say, 
100,000 shares of a stock, breaking it into 1,000 orders of 100 shares each, 
and spreading the orders out over a window of time. Of course, by spread-
ing the order out over time, the trader runs the risk that the price may move 
more while the order is being spread out than it would have if it had been 
executed right away, even with the extra cost of market impact.
Generally, however , it is agreed that spreading out trades is a useful way 
to reduce the cost of transacting, and this is an extremely common feature 
in execution algorithms. The exact size of the chunks that are sent to mar -
ket to be executed depends on the transaction cost model’s estimate of the 
transaction cost of variously sized orders for the instrument in question. The 
determination of the size of each order is related to the analysis of the cor -
rect level of aggressiveness. Again, a highly attractive trade warrants taking 
on more of it quickly than a trade that is relatively less appealing.
But if not, this much aggressiveness in the order placement might not be 
necessary, and the transaction can be executed in a different manner . For ex-
ample, a trader might find that taking whatever liquidity is available at the 
best offer (on a buy trade, for example) and then waiting for others to step 
in and offer the same price a moment later could allow the same volume of 
shares to be acquired at whatever the best offer was at the time that the first 
piece of the order was executed, rather than a worse average price achieved 
by sweeping through multiple levels of the order book.
Where to Send an Order
In some markets, there are several pools of liquidity for the same instru-
ments. For example, BATS and Archipelago are currently two alternative 
pools of liquidity for trading U.S. stocks. There is a whole field of work in 
the area of smart order routing, which involves determining to which pool 
of liquidity it is best to send a given order at the current moment. Typically, 
the determination itself is straightforward. If one pool of liquidity has the 
units of a security you want for a better price than another pool of liquidity, 
you are better off routing the order to the first pool.
We described a problem with Reg NMS in “Other Order T ypes. ” The pur-
pose of NMS was to mitigate the perceived problem of having different “best” 
prices for a given stock in different pools of liquidity , and it was enacted in 

## Page 148

128  Ins I de the Black Box
2007. One of the consequences of this rule is that the best bid and offer for 
a stock across any valid pool of liquidity must be displayed by all pools of 
liquidity concurrently . This somewhat mitigates the purpose of smart order 
routing in U.S. equities. However , there are many other markets in which 
a fragmented structure exists, and in those, the importance of smart order 
routing is unchanged. Further , there remain other temporal or longer‐lived 
differences between the various liquidity pools in U.S. equities. For example, 
the depth of liquidity for a given name may vary tremendously from moment 
to moment on various exchanges. There are also differing rebate and fee lev-
els for providing or taking liquidity on various exchanges, so intelligence still 
needs to be applied to order routing even in the case of the U.S. equity market.
A more recent development in market structure is the increased role of 
so‐called dark pools to execute orders. Exchanges can be categorized as be-
ing lit or dark. Lit exchanges show market participants the prices and sizes 
of bids and offers available in the limit order book. Dark exchanges provide 
no such information. The most relevant feature of a dark pool is that it facil-
itates the execution of large orders, because orders placed on a dark pool are 
not revealed. Instead, if there is a buyer or seller who has placed an offer (for 
example) that takes the other side of a large trade, then the order executes at 
that price. But no investors other than the two parties that transacted know 
that the trade happened. Thinking back to what we described in “Aggressive 
versus Passive” about the shape of an order book factoring into a prospec-
tive participant’s trading decision, giving no information about your order 
to the rest of the marketplace is clearly beneficial. In the U.S. equity market, 
it is estimated that more than 30 percent of volumes are now transacted 
on dark pools.
5 Given the rise to prominence of dark liquidity pools, they 
require consideration in the forming of order routing logic.
It is worth noting that the term dark liquidity encapsulates any transac-
tions that do not occur on the lit exchanges. For example, as we will discuss in 
more detail in Chapter 15, most retail orders are filled by contracted market 
makers, and these orders never actually make it to the exchange. Coupled with 
dark pool volumes, dark liquidity has been an increasing portion of the vol-
umes in U.S. equities, which has made for an interesting storyline to watch. In 
some senses, there is a battle being waged between exchanges and dark pools, 
between exchanges and contractual market makers, and between contractual 
market makers and noncontractual market makers.
t rading i nfra S tru C ture
We have already mentioned that, to execute and process electronic trades, 
connectivity needs to be set up between the trader and the exchange. 

## Page 149

Execution 129
Furthermore, a protocol for messages between these two parties is required. 
The hardware and software quants utilize in implementing their trading 
strategies are the final pieces of infrastructure. As in most things, quants face 
a choice between building or buying infrastructure in all three of these areas. 
Due to regulatory and other constraints, most traders utilize the services of 
independent brokerage firms that act as the trading agents for their strate-
gies. One of the benefits of using a broker is that the infrastructure require-
ments are handled by that broker , and this infrastructure can be costly to 
replicate.
The most common type of exchange connectivity offered to a trader is, 
as already discussed, DMA access. This involves using the broker’s servers 
and routing orders through them to the various pools of liquidity being 
traded. However , some quants, especially those engaged in high‐frequen -
cy strategies, utilize a more recently available form of connectivity called 
colocation. Brokers offer easy access to markets through DMA platforms, 
but they add a fair amount of latency to the process. Quant strategies that 
are sensitive to this latency utilize the colocation option as a way of im -
proving their communication speeds. In a colocation setup, the trader at -
tempts to place his trading servers as physically close to the exchange as 
possible. In many cases, this means hosting servers in the same data centers 
as those of the exchange. The reason for the desire for proximity is quite 
literally to cut down to as short as possible the distance that the order must 
travel—at the speed of light—over the communication lines between the 
quant’s server and the exchange. A typical and relatively high‐quality DMA 
platform tends to cause between 10 and 30 milliseconds of delay between 
the time the order is sent from the quant’s server and the time the order 
reaches the exchange. By contrast, a well‐designed colocation solution can 
have an order travel from the quant’s server to the exchange in a fraction 
of a millisecond. For latency‐sensitive execution strategies, this can be a 
useful improvement.
In terms of communication, the most important piece of infrastructure 
in electronic trading is known as the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) 
protocol. The FIX protocol began in 1992 as a communications framework 
between Fidelity Investments and Salomon Brothers and has grown to be-
come the method of choice for real‐time electronic communication among 
most of the world’s banks, money managers using electronic executions, and 
exchanges offering electronic equities or futures trading. The FIX protocol 
is a standardized way for various participants in the trading process to com-
municate information. Considering that the number of order and execution 
messages is measured in billions per day, it is obviously critical to have a 
standard format for these communications. The FIX protocol is free and 
open source, but the software that implements the FIX protocol is known as 

## Page 150

130  Ins I de the Black Box
a FIX engine, and not all FIX engines are created equal. Quants must choose 
whether to build or buy such engines, and a fair number of quants land in 
each camp. In general, quants who are extremely sensitive to latency, such as 
high‐frequency traders, will likely build their own customized FIX engines 
to ensure optimal speeds.
The final component of trading infrastructure relates to the hardware 
and software used. Again, quants can choose to build or to buy various 
solutions. For example, it is easy to buy computers built with standard 
hardware (such as microchips, data storage, etc.), utilize off‐the‐shelf or -
der management systems (which process and manage trades), or utilize 
third‐party execution algorithms. On the other hand, some quant firms 
have customized their own microchips to perform specialized trading‐
related functions with greater speed than conventional, commercially 
available chips. It is generally found that such hardware customization al -
lows greater speeds than any purely software‐based solution. However , it 
is a more rigid process, and unlike software, once hardware is customized, 
it is difficult to change.
Beyond this, quants attempt to make their algorithms, databases, and 
execution software leaner , to reduce the internal latency of processing mar-
ket data and sending an order out to the market. Even the most fundamental 
choices about computers—for example, the operating system of choice—are 
considered. For instance, most quants use either Linux or UNIX operating 
systems because they are more easily configurable and more efficient and 
therefore provide better computing performance than a PC/Windows con-
figuration. I remember some years ago having a quant firm describe to me 
their use of the processors that were used in the Sony Playstation 3, because 
it was a categorically faster processor than what was found in even a power-
ful PC or server . Since then, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which drive 
the video cards found in our computers, have been pressed into service for 
quant trading applications, because they are designed to operate at higher 
speeds than CPUs usually can.
Summary
We have detailed a variety of issues related to the execution of orders 
for a quant trading strategy. The very first choice the quant must make 
is whether to build or buy a trading solution. The technical expertise 
and cost of building a world‐class execution infrastructure lead many 
quants, especially those utilizing longer‐term trading strategies or those 
trading smaller portfolios, to choose the route of buying these services, 
either from brokers or execution service providers. Both brokers and 

## Page 151

Execution 131
execution vendors do, in fact, charge for the service of providing execu -
tion algorithms and connectivity. This charge normally is made by in -
creasing commission costs. It can often cost five or more times as much 
per share to trade through a third party’s algorithms than to trade using 
one’s own. Thus, for traders who have expertise in this area and for those 
managing significant sums, it can be worthwhile to build custom execu -
tion models and infrastructure.
Execution is where the rubber meets the road for a quant system and 
how the quant interacts with the rest of the marketplace. This continues to 
be a fruitful area of research, as it has been ever since markets have begun 
to become electronic. This chapter concludes our stroll inside the black box, 
as we can see from Exhibit 7.1. We turn our attention now to understanding 
the data that feed quant trading strategies.

umes, brokers have other sources of revenue from the activities of their clients. 
For example, clearing fees also apply for management of settlement and hold-

revenue.

—Anonymous quantitative futures trader
t
he old adage is “garbage in, garbage out,” meaning that if you use bad 
inputs, you’ll get bad outputs. This relates to quant trading because most 
quants utilize some form of input/output model, which is a term that comes 
from computer science (and that has been borrowed by econometricians). It 
refers to the way in which information processors (such as computers) com-
municate with the world around them. One of the things we love about input/
output models is that if you provide the same input a million times, the output 
should be consistent every time. The process that transforms an input into an 
output is typically the part that people call the black box in quant trading, and 
we have seen the inside of this box in the preceding chapters. In this chapter , we 
examine the inputs of quant trading models, namely , the data they depend on.
Mechanically , data reach the black box through data servers, which are 
connected to one or more data sources. On receipt of these data, the black box 
processes them for use by the alpha, risk, transaction cost, portfolio construc-
tion, and execution models that constitute the internal organs of the quant 
trading machine. These data servers usually process data using software some 
quants call data feed handlers, which are designed to convert the data to a form 
in which they can be stored and utilized by the modules of the quant system.
t he Importan C e of Data
It is difficult to overstate the importance of data, and it can be seen from 
many perspectives. First, data, as we know, are the inputs to quant trading 

## Page 154

134  Ins I de the Black Box
systems. It turns out that the nature of the inputs to a system dictates what 
you can do with the system itself. For example, if you were handed a lot of 
lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers, it would be very difficult to build, say, a 
jet engine. Instead, you might decide that these inputs are most suited for 
making a salad. T o make a jet engine, you more or less need jet engine parts, 
or at least materials that can handle high velocities and acceleration, high 
altitude, and a wide range of temperatures. The same is true with quant 
systems. T o the extent that you are given data that focus on macroeconomic 
activity, it is extremely difficult to build a useful model that doesn’t some-
how reflect macroeconomic concepts.
Frequently, many details of the model itself are driven by characteristics 
of the inputs that are used. Refining our example, imagine that you are given 
slow‐moving macroeconomic data, such as quarterly U.S. GDP figures; fur-
thermore, you receive them only a week after they are released to the public. 
In this situation, it is unlikely that you can build a very fast trading model 
that looks to hold positions for only a few minutes. Furthermore, note that 
the U.S. data you get might be useful for predicting bonds or currency rela-
tionships, but they might not be sufficient to build a helpful model of equity 
markets. U.S. GDP data will also tell you little about what is happening in 
Uruguay or Poland in any of their securities markets.
The nature of the data you are using is also an important determinant 
of the database technology you would rationally choose for storage and 
retrieval, a subject we will discuss in greater detail later in this chapter . Data 
sometimes even drive decisions about what types of hardware and software 
make the most sense. Again and again, we see that the nature of data—and 
even how they are delivered—determines a great deal about what can be 
done and how one would actually go about doing it.
Still another perspective on the importance of data can be understood 
by examining the consequences of not doing a good job of gathering and 
handling data. Returning to the idea that quant trading systems are input/
output models, if you feed the model bad data, it has little hope of produc-
ing accurate or even usable results. A stunning example of this concept can 
be seen in the failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO) in 1999. The 
$200 million satellite was destroyed by atmospheric friction because one 
team of software engineers programmed the software that controlled the 
craft’s thrusters to expect metric units of force (Newtons) while another 
team programmed the data delivered to the satellite to be in English units 
(pound‐force). The software model that controlled the satellite’s thrusters 
ran faithfully, but because the data were in the wrong units (causing them 
to be off by a factor of almost 4.5 times), the satellite drifted off course, fell 
too close to Mars’ surface, and ended up being destroyed. In the aftermath, 
National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) management did 

## Page 155

not blame the software error but rather the process used to check and re-
check the software and the data being fed to it.1
Problems, however , can be easy to miss. After all, the results frequently 
are numbers that can be seen to as many decimal places as you care to see. 
But this is false precision. That we have a number that goes out to several 
decimal places may not mean that we can rely on this number at all. Because 
the kind of trading with which we are concerned is all about timing, timeli-
ness is critical. If you build a fantastic model to forecast the price of a stock 
over the next day, but you don’t provide it data until a week later , what good 
is the model? This is an extreme example, but it is almost exclusively the 
case that the faster you can get accurate information into a good model, the 
better off you’ll be, at least if succeeding is part of your plan.
Bad data can also lead to countless hours of squandered research and, 
in extreme cases, even to invalid theorization. Data are generally needed 
to develop a theory about the markets or anything else in science, just 
as physical scientists utilize their observations of the world to generate 
their theories. So, if we provide the scientist with incorrect information 
without her knowledge, she is likely to develop theories that are incorrect 
when applied to the real world. Bad data lead to bad outcomes. If the data 
have serious problems, it will be impossible to tell whether a system being 
tested, no matter how sophisticated the testing nor how elegant the model, 
is good or bad.
Many quant trading firms recognize this point in their behavior . Most 
of the best firms collect their own data from primary sources rather than 
purchasing it from data vendors. They also expend significant resources in 
the effort to speed up their access to data, to clean data, and even to de-
velop better ways of storing data. Some firms have dozens or even hundreds 
of employees dedicated exclusively to capturing, cleaning, and storing data 
optimally.
t ypes of Data
There are basically two kinds of data: price data and fundamental data. 
Price data are actually not solely related to the prices of instruments; they in-
clude other information received or derived from exchanges or transactions. 
Other examples of price data are the trading volumes for stocks or the time 
and size of each trade. Indeed, the entire order book, which shows a con-
tinuous series of all bids and offers for a given instrument throughout the 
course of a day as well as the amounts of each, would be considered price‐
related data. Furthermore, we would place anything that can be derived 
from the levels of various indices (e.g., percent changes computed from the

daily values of the S&P 500 index) in the price‐related data category, even if 
the computed value is not a traded instrument.
The rather broad variety of fundamental data can make it difficult 
to categorize effectively. In a sense, fundamental data relate to anything 
besides prices. However , what all types of data have in common is that they 
are expected to have some usefulness in helping to determine the price of an 
instrument in the future, or at least to describe the instrument in the present. 
Also, we can do a bit more to create a reasonable taxonomy of fundamental 
data. The most common kinds of fundamental data are financial health, 
financial performance, financial worth, and sentiment. For single stocks, for 
example, a company’s balance sheet is mostly used to indicate the financial 
health of the company. Meanwhile, for macroeconomic securities (e.g., 
government bonds or currencies), budget, trade deficit, or personal savings 
data might serve to indicate the financial health of a nation. Portions of the 
income and cash‐flow statements (e.g., total net profits or free cash flow) 
are used to determine financial performance; other portions are used to 
indicate financial health (e.g., ratios of accruals to total revenue or cash 
flow to earnings). Similarly, the U.S. GDP figure might be an example of 
macroeconomic financial performance data, whereas the trade balances 
figure is an example of macroeconomic financial health data. The third 
type of fundamental data relates to the worth of a financial instrument. 
Some common examples of this kind of data in the equities world are 
the book value or the amount of cash on hand. The last common type 
of fundamental data is sentiment. How analysts rate a stock, the buying 
and selling activity of company insiders, and information related to the 
implied volatility of the options on a stock are examples of sentiment data 
for stocks; economists’ forecasts for GDP growth for next quarter are an 
example of macroeconomic sentiment data.
We don’t want to oversimplify the matter . Clever researchers are con-
stantly looking for new and innovative sources of information that might not 
be used by other players. Technology advances in the broader marketplace 
have greatly aided this kind of activity. For example, some firms (and now 
even some data vendors) quantitatively analyze news stories written in plain 
English. Quants can systematically parse these stories, extract quantifiable 
information, and build strategies around this type of data. However , this 
remains largely an exercise in getting faster and more robust indicators of 
sentiment (or other types of fundamentals already described), so we believe 
that sources such as this are still fundamental in nature. We know of at least 
one company that is attempting to use aggregated global positioning system 
(GPS) data to determine the level of various types of economic activity more 
quickly and accurately than is possible using government‐reported statistics. 
But this too seems to be a potential improvement (even a revolution) in the 

## Page 157

approach to collecting such data; the nature of the fundamental information 
being sought is by no means different than it was. This is not to diminish the 
ingenuity of those who developed such ideas. We simply point out that our 
classification scheme seems to do a reasonable job of explaining the kinds 
of data that exist.
An interesting pattern has emerged in our discussion of data. Much 
of what we saw in the price category of data tended to focus on shorter 
timescales. We spoke about daily values and even continuous intraday values. 
Meanwhile, in the fundamental category , we tend to see new information 
released on the scale of weeks, months, or quarters. One implication we can 
immediately discern from these differing periodicities is that, in general, trad-
ing strategies utilizing price‐related information have the option to be much 
faster than those utilizing primarily fundamental information. Again, this is 
simply because the information we have about the securities is refreshed more 
frequently with price‐related information than it usually is with fundamental 
data. This statement is not universal, since some fundamental strategies, es-
pecially those focused on changes in fundamentals or sentiment, can be very 
short‐term‐oriented. However , this statement holds most of the time and is a 
handy rule of thumb to bear in mind when looking at a quant strategy .
s our C es of Data
One can get data from many sources. Most direct, but also perhaps most 
challenging, is to get raw data from the primary sources. In other words, a 
quant would get price data for stocks traded on the New York Stock Ex-
change directly from the NYSE. This has the benefit of allowing the quant 
maximum control over the cleaning and storing of data, and it can also 
have significant benefits in terms of speed. However , there is also a mas-
sive cost to doing things this way. It would require building connectivity to 
every primary source, and if we are speaking about trading multiple types 
of instruments (e.g., stocks and futures) across multiple geographical mar -
kets and exchanges, the number of data sources can explode. With each, 
software must be built to translate the primary sources’ unique formats into 
something usable by the quant’s trading systems.
Examples of the kinds of primary sources and data types include:
■■ Exchanges. Prices, volumes, timestamps, open interest, short interest, 
order book data.
■■ Regulators. Financial statements from individual companies, filings re-
lated to large owners of individual stocks as well as insider buying and 
selling activities.

## Page 158

138  Ins I de the Black Box
■■ Governments. Macroeconomic data, such as employment, inflation, or 
GDP data.
■■ Corporations. Announcements of financial results and other relevant 
developments (e.g., changes in dividends).
■■ News agencies. Press releases or news articles.
■■ Proprietary data vendors (or data generators). House‐created data that 
might be of interest. For example, brokerage firms frequently issue re-
ports about companies, and some firms track and license investment 
funds‐flow data.
Because of the scope of the work involved in accessing data directly 
from primary sources, many firms use secondary data vendors to solve some 
aspects of the data problem. For example, some data vendors take financial 
statement data from regulatory filings around the world and create quanti-
fied databases that they then license to quant traders. In this example, the 
data vendor is being paid for having solved the problem of building a con-
sistent framework to house and categorize data from many direct sources. 
But imagine that the quant firm wants to collect both price and fundamental 
data about companies around the world. It is frequently the case that en-
tirely different companies provide each of these types of data. For instance, 
for a given stock, there may be one data vendor providing price data and a 
completely different one providing fundamental data. These data vendors 
may also differ in the way they identify stocks. One might use the ticker; an-
other might use a SEDOL code or some other identifier .
2 With two or more 
different data sets regarding the same security, the quant will have to find a 
way to ensure that all the data ultimately find their way into the same com-
pany’s record in the quant’s internal database. The tool used to help with 
this is frequently called a security master in that it is the master file mapping 
the various ways that data vendors identify stocks to a single, unique identi-
fier method that the quant will use in her trading system.
As you may have guessed, still other firms have cropped up to provide 
unified databases across many types of vendors and data types. These we 
can call tertiary data vendors , and they are paid to make data easy to ac -
cess for the quant. They establish connections with many primary and 
secondary data vendors, build and maintain security masters, and even 
perform some data‐cleaning activities (a subject we will discuss in more 
detail presently). As a result, they are immensely popular among many 
firms. However , we should make it clear that as much benefit as they offer 
in terms of ease, tertiary data vendors do add another layer between the 
quant and the original data. This layer can result in loss of speed and pos -
sibly in less control over the methods used to clean, store, or access data 
on an ongoing basis.

Having established the types and importance of data, we now turn to the 
kinds of problems quants face in managing these raw materials and how 
they handle such flaws. Despite the efforts of primary, secondary, and some-
times even tertiary data vendors, data are often either missing or incorrect in 
some way. If ignored, this problem can lead to disastrous consequences for 
the quant. This section addresses some of the common problems found with 
errors and some of the better‐known approaches used to deal with these 
challenges. It’s worth noting that although some of the following data prob-
lems seem egregious or obvious to a human, it can be challenging to notice 
such problems in a trading system that is processing millions of data points 
hourly (or even within one minute, as in the case of high‐frequency traders).
The first common type of data problem is missing data, as we alluded 
to already. Missing data occur when a piece of information existed in reality 
but for some reason was not provided by the data supplier . This is obviously 
an issue because without data, the system has nothing to go on. Worse still, 
by withholding just some portion of the data, systems can make erroneous 
computations. Two common approaches are used to solve the problem of 
missing data. The first is to build the system so that it “understands” that 
data can in fact go missing, in which case the system doesn’t act rashly 
when there are no data over some limited time period. For example, many 
databases automatically assign a value of zero to a data point that is miss-
ing. After all, zero and nothing have a lot in common. However , there is a 
very different implication to the model thinking the price is now zero (for 
example, if we were long the instrument, we’d be showing a 100 percent loss 
on the position) versus thinking that the price is unknown at the moment.
T o fix this problem, many quants program their database and trading 
systems to recognize the difference between zero and blank. This frequently 
means simply using the last known price until a new one is available. The 
second approach is to try to interpolate what a reasonable value might be 
in place of the missing data. This is useful for historical data rather than 
real‐time data, but a variation of the method described here can be used for 
real‐time data as well.
Let’s take an example of a semiconductor company’s listed stock. 
Imagine that we know the price of a semiconductor stock immediately be-
fore and immediately after the missing data point (this is why this technique 
is mainly useful to back‐fill missing data points in a database). We could 
simply interpolate the price of the stock as being midway between the price 
immediately before and immediately after the gap. Imagine further that 
we know how the stock index, the tech sector , the semiconductor industry, 
and some close competitors performed for the period that is missing. By 

## Page 160

140  Ins I de the Black Box
combining information about the periods around the missing point and the 
action of related things during the missing period, it is possible to compute 
a sensible value for the stock’s missing data point. Though we aren’t guar -
anteed and in fact aren’t terribly likely to get the number exactly right, at 
least we have something reasonable that won’t cause our systems problems.
A second type of data problem is the presence of incorrect values. For 
instance, decimal errors are a common problem. T o take the example of 
U.K. stocks, they are sometimes quoted in pounds and sometimes in pence. 
Obviously , if a system is expecting to receive a figure in pounds and it receives a 
number that doesn’t advertise itself as being anything other than pounds, prob-
lems can abound. Instead of being quoted as, say , £10, it is quoted as 1,000; 
that is, 1,000 pence. This can result in the model being told that the price has 
spiked dramatically upward, which can cause all sorts of other mayhem (for 
example, a naive system without data checks might want to short the stock 
aggressively if it suddenly and inexplicably jumped 100‐fold in an instant). 
Alternatively , a price might simply be wrong. Exchanges and other sources of 
data frequently put out bad prints, which are data points that simply never 
happened at all or at least didn’t happen the way the data source indicates.
By far the most common type of tool used to help address this issue 
is something we call a spike filter. Spike filters look for abnormally large, 
sudden moves in prices and either smooth these out or eliminate them alto-
gether . Further complicating the matter , it should be noted that sometimes 
spikes really do happen. In these circumstances, a spike filter may reject a 
value that is valid, either ignoring it or replacing it with an erroneous value. 
An interesting example of this is shown in Exhibit 8.1. In this case, during 
the trading day of July 15, 2008, the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate with the 
Mexican peso quickly fell about 3 percent, then regained virtually all that 
ground in a matter of seconds.

This behavior is not reserved for less commonly traded instruments, 
however . The 10‐year German bund, one of the more liquid futures con-
tracts in the world, dropped about 1.4 percent in a few seconds during the 
day of March 28, 2008, only to recover immediately (see Exhibit 8.2).
A spike filter might well have called this a bad print, but it really hap-
pened. T o reduce the impact of this problem, some quants use spike filters 
to alert a human supervisor to look into the matter further , and the human 
can then decide, based on what she sees as the facts, on what to do about the 
strange price. Still another common approach, though useful only if there 
is more than one source for a given piece of data, is to cross‐check a data 
set given by one provider against one provided by a second source. If they 
match, it is more likely to be a correct price. If they do not match, one or 
both of them must be wrong. Of course, what to do when two vendors don’t 
match each other is a whole other ball of wax. A final common approach to 
cleaning data problems is to utilize the same approach as described earlier 
in addressing the problem of missing data by looking to the points before 
and after the “bad” data point and/or by looking to the behavior of related 
instruments to interpolate an approximate value.
Another very common type of data error relates to corporate actions 
such as splits and dividends. Imagine a ticker that splits 3:1. Generally, 
the price drops by about two‐thirds to offset the threefold increase in the 
number of shares.
3 Imagine that the data vendor doesn’t record this as a 
split, and therefore doesn’t adjust the back‐history to reflect this corporate 
action. In this scenario, the quant trader’s system may be misled to believe 
that the stock simply dropped 67 percent overnight. This is generally han-
dled by independently tracking corporate actions, together with the human‐
oversight version of a spike filter , described previously.

Another frustrating problem is that the data sometimes contain incor -
rect timestamps. This is generally a problem with intraday or real‐time data, 
but it has been known to be an issue with other data as well. This is also 
one of the tougher problems to solve. Obviously, the path of a time series 
is fairly important, especially since the goal of the quant trader focused on 
alpha is to figure out when to be long, short, or out of a given security. As 
such, if the time series is shuffled because of an error in the data source, 
it can be deeply problematic. A quant researcher could believe her system 
works when in reality it doesn’t,
4 or she could believe her system doesn’t 
work when in reality it does. 5 If the quant trading firm stores its own data 
in real time, it can track timestamps received versus the internal clocks of 
the machines doing the storing and ensure that there are correct timestamps, 
which is perhaps the most effective way of addressing this issue. But to do so 
requires storing one’s own data reliably in real time and writing software to 
check the timestamp of each and every data point against a system clock in 
a way that doesn’t slow the system down too much, making this a difficult 
problem to address. It should be noted that this approach only works for 
those quants who capture and store their own data in real time. For those 
that are relying on purchased databases, they can only cross‐check data 
from various sources.
Finally, a more subtle type of data challenge bears mentioning here. 
This is known as look‐ahead bias and is a subject to which we will devote 
attention several times in this book. Look‐ahead bias refers to the problem 
of wrongly assuming that you could have known something before it would 
have been possible to know it. Another way to phrase this is “getting yes-
terday’s news the day before yesterday. ” We will examine look‐ahead bias in 
the chapter on research, but for now, let’s examine a particular form of this 
bias that comes from the data. Specifically, it derives from asynchronicity in 
the data.
A common example of asynchronicity can be found in the regulatory 
filings of financial statements (known as 10‐Qs) made by companies each 
quarter in the United States. Companies report their financial statements as 
of each quarter end. However , these reports are usually released four to eight 
weeks after the end of the quarter . Let’s imagine the first quarter of 2010 
has just ended. On May 1, 2010, Acme Concrete Inc. reports that its first‐
quarter earnings were $1 per share as of March 31 and furthermore that the 
general analyst community was expecting only $0.50 per share, making the 
result a strongly positive surprise. Once the data point is available, most data 
vendors will report that Acme’s earnings per share were $1 per share as of 
March 31, even though the number wasn’t released until May 1.
Three years later , a quant is testing a strategy that uses earnings data 
from this vendor . The data indicate that Acme’s earnings were $1 per share 

## Page 163

Data 143
for the quarter ending March 31, and her model assumes this to be true, 
even though in reality she would never have been able to know this until 
the estimate was released a month later , on May 1. In the back‐test, she sees 
that her model buys Acme in April because its P/E ratio looks appealing 
from April 1 onward, given the $1‐per‐share earnings result, even though 
the model would not have known about the $1 earnings figure until May 1 
if she had been trading back then. Suddenly the strategy makes a huge prof-
it on the position in early May, when the world, and her model, actually 
would have found out about the earnings surprise. This kind of problem 
also happens with macroeconomic data (such as the unemployment rate), 
which frequently get revised some months after their initial release. Without 
careful tracking of the revision history for such data, the quant can be left 
with the same issue as demonstrated in the equity example: believing that 
she could have had revised data in the past when in fact she would only have 
had the less accurate initial data release.
If the quant ignores this data error , she can end up making a Type I error 
again: believing that her strategy is profitable and sound, even though it may 
in fact only look that way because she’s made a substantial data error . T o ad-
dress look‐ahead bias in the data, quants can record the date at which new 
information is actually made available and only make the data available for 
testing at the appropriate time. In addition, quants can put an artificial lag 
on the data they are concerned about so that the model’s awareness of this 
information is delayed sufficiently to overcome the look‐ahead bias issues. 
Note that look‐ahead issues with regard to data are specific to research, 
which we will discuss further in the next chapter . In live trading, there is no 
such thing as look‐ahead bias, and in fact quants would want all relevant 
data to be available to their systems as immediately as possible.
Another type of look‐ahead bias stemming from asynchronicity in the 
data is a result of the various closing times of markets around the world. 
The SPY (the ETF tracking the S&P 500) trades until 4:15 p .m., whereas the 
stocks that constitute the S&P 500 index stop trading at 4:00 p .m. European 
stock markets close from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p .m., New York time. Asian 
markets are already closed on a given day by the time New York opens. 
In many cases, the considerable impact that U.S. news and trading activity 
have on European or Asian markets cannot be felt until the next trading day.
On Friday , October 10, 2008, for example, the Nikkei 225 fell more than 
9 percent for the day . But it was already closed by the time New York opened. 
European markets closed down between 7 and 10 percent for the same day . 
At the time of Europe’s closing, the S&P 500 was down about 6 percent for 
the day . Suddenly , however , just after 2:00 p .m. EST on the 10th, with two 
hours remaining in U.S. trading but the rest of the world already gone for the 
weekend, the S&P 500 rallied, closing down just over 1 percent. Monday the

13th was a market holiday in Japan. Europe tried to make up ground that 
Monday , with the key markets closing up over 11 percent but the U.S. mar-
ket up “only” about 6 percent by midday in New York. However , by the end 
of the trading day , the U.S. market closed up over 11 percent as well, leaving 
the European markets behind again. The next day , the Nikkei reopened on 
the 14th and ended up 14 percent. On their subsequent day , European mar-
kets closed up about 3 percent, whereas the U.S. market was down slightly 
by the end of its own trading day . Ignoring this kind of asynchronicity can be 
extremely problematic for analyses of closing price data because these clos-
ing prices occur at different times on the same day .
These are but a few examples of the many subtle ways in which look‐
ahead bias seeps into the process of research and money management, even 
for discretionary traders. A key challenge for the quant is deciding how to 
manage this problem in its myriad forms.
s tor I ng Data
Databases are used to store collected data for later use, and they come in 
several varieties. The first type of database is known as the flat file. Flat files 
are two‐dimensional databases, much like an ordinary spreadsheet. Flat file 
databases are loved for their leanness, because there is very little baggage 
or overhead to slow them down. It is a simple file structure that can be 
searched very easily, usually in a sequential manner (i.e., from the first row 
of data onward to the last). However , you can easily imagine that searching 
for a data point near the bottom row of a very large flat file with millions of 
rows may take rather a long time. T o help with this problem, many quants 
use indexed flat files, which add an extra step but which can make search-
ing large files easier . The index gives the computer a sort of cheat sheet, 
providing an algorithm to search large sets of data more intelligently than 
a sequential search.
A second important type of data storage is a relational database. 
Relational databases allow for more complex relationships among the 
data set. For example, imagine that we want to keep track of stocks not 
just on their own but also as part of industry groups, as part of sectors, 
as part of broader indices for the countries of their domicile, and as part 
of the universe of stocks overall. This is a fairly routine thing to want to 
do. With flat files, we would have to construct each of these groups as a 
separate table. This is fine if nothing ever changes with the constituents of 
each table. But in reality, every time there is a corporate action, a merger , 
or any other event that would cause us to want to modify the record for a 
single stock in any one of these tables, we have to remember to update all 

## Page 165

Data 145
of them. Instead, in the world of relational databases, we can simply cre -
ate a database table that contains attributes of each stock—for example, 
the industry, sector , market, and universe it is in. Given this table, we can 
simply manage the table of information for the stock itself and for its at -
tributes. From there, the database will take care of the rest based on the 
established relationship. Though relational databases allow for powerful 
searches, they can also be slow and cumbersome because their searches 
can span many tables as well as the meta tables that establish the relation -
ships among the data tables.
An important type of relational database is known as a data cube, a la-
bel I have borrowed from Sudhir Chhikara, the former head of quantitative 
trading at Stark Investments. Data cubes force consistency into a relational 
database by keeping all the values for all the attributes of all instruments 
in a single, three‐dimensional table. For a given date, then, all instruments 
would be listed in one axis of this table. A second axis would store all the 
values for a given attribute (e.g., closing price for that date) across the vari-
ous instruments. The third axis would store other attributes (e.g., earnings 
per share as of that date). This method has the benefit of simplifying the 
relationships in a way that is rather useful. In other words, it hardwires 
certain relationships; furthermore, by keeping all attributes of each instru-
ment available every day, there is no need to search for the last available 
data point for a given attribute and security. For every day, a data cube is 
created to store all the relevant data. This approach, too, has its potential 
disadvantages. Hardwiring the relationships leads to inflexibility, so if the 
nature of the relationships or the method of querying the data changes, it 
can be problematic.
Each of these data storage approaches has advantages and disadvantag-
es. It would be easy to make some assumptions and declare one the “best,” 
but the reality is that the best technique is dependent on the problem that 
needs to be solved. Here, as in so many other parts of the black box, the 
quant’s judgment determines success or failure.
s ummary
In this chapter , we explained some of the basic concepts of data for use by 
quant trading systems. Though data are scarcely the most exciting part of a 
quant strategy, they are so integral and critical to everything quants do and 
inform so much of how to think about a given quant system that they are 
well worth understanding.
Next we will dive into the research process as our final stop in the ex-
ploration of the black box (Exhibit 8.3).

For the sake of simplicity, we are ignoring any split effect, which many people 
believe exists; this theory states that stocks tend not to fall as much as expected 
based on the size of the split because people like to buy nominally lower‐priced

Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler .

r
esearch is the heart of quant trading. It is in large part because of well‐de-
signed, rigorous, and tireless research programs that the best quants earn 
their laurels. This chapter gives an overview of what research really means 
for black‐box traders. It focuses mostly on research targeted at developing 
the alpha models of trading strategies. Research is also done with regard 
to risk models, transaction cost models, portfolio construction models, ex-
ecution algorithms, and monitoring tools. Relevant research topics in these 
other areas will be mentioned as necessary, but the general principles from 
this section hold true throughout the black box.
The purpose of research is to scrutinize a well‐conceived investment 
strategy. A strategy is a long‐term course of action designed to achieve an 
objective, usually success or victory. In most applied settings, strategies are 
chosen from a limitless number of alternatives. One can find interesting 
examples in nearly every field: curing cancer , a baseball game, a war , a court 
case, or financial planning. In each case, one has many choices of strategy; so 
how is one chosen? In the case of quant trading, a strategy is chosen based 
on research, which has its roots in the natural sciences.

A characteristic shared among well‐behaved quants is their adherence to the 
scientific method in conducting research, which is of course the way science 
is done in every other field of study. This is critical because it forces rigor 
and discipline into the single most judgment‐driven portion of the entire

quant trading process. Without such rigor , quants could easily be led astray 
by wishful thinking and emotion rather than the logic and consistency that 
make scientists useful to the world in so many other disciplines.
The scientific method begins with the scientist observing something in 
the world that might be explainable. Put differently, the scientist sees a pat-
tern in her observations. For example, in most circumstances, if something is 
above the ground and is left unsupported, it falls toward the ground. Second, 
the scientist forms a theory to explain the observations. Sticking with the 
same theme in our examples, the scientist can theorize that there is some-
thing inherent in all things that causes them to move toward each other . This 
is better known as the theory of gravity. Third, the scientist must deduce 
consequences of the theory. If gravity exists, the orbits of planets should be 
predictable using the consequences of the theory of gravity. Fourth comes 
the all‐important testing of the theory. But rather than looking to “prove” a 
theory, properly done science seeks to find the opposite of the consequences 
deduced, which would therefore disprove the theory. In the case of gravity, 
Newton’s theory was used to predict the existence of Neptune, based on 
motions in the orbit of Uranus that could not be explained by other then‐
known celestial bodies. But this success could at best provide support for 
Newton’s theory and could never actually prove it. Karl Popper , the eminent 
philosopher of science, labeled this technique falsification. A theory that has 
not yet been disproved can be accepted as true for the moment. But we can 
never be certain that the next observation we make of the theory will not 
falsify it. Newton’s theory of gravity was never “proved” and in fact was 
superseded by Einstein’s general relativity theory. The latter also has not 
been proven, and alternatives have been proposed to help explain problems 
(such as the accelerating expansion of the universe or the unexpectedly high 
velocities of stars in the outskirts of galaxies) that neither Newton’s laws nor 
Einstein’s relativity address in their current form.
Looking at the markets, it is easy to see the parallels with the way 
quants conduct research. First, let’s imagine that a quant researcher observes 
that the various markets go through phases in which they tend to rise for 
extended periods, followed by phases in which they tend to fall for awhile. 
She theorizes that a phenomenon called a trend exists, which, for whatever 
reason, causes the future performance of a market to be in the same direc-
tion as its recent historical performance. The consequence of this theory 
would be that she should be able to achieve a better‐than‐random forecast 
of how markets will perform, given only information on how these markets 
have performed before. So, she sets out to test the theory, and lo and behold, 
she finds that the evidence does not contradict her theory. Using some metric 
to define the historical trend (such as the moving average crossover example 
we used in Chapter 3), she sees that she can indeed forecast markets better

than random chance is likely to allow. But she can never be sure. At best, 
she can have enough confidence that her tests were sufficiently rigorous to 
warrant risking some capital on the validity of this theory.
One important distinction, however , exists between quants and sci-
entists. Scientists conduct research for many purposes, including learning 
the truth that drives the natural world. And in the natural sciences, a good 
theory—one that is well supported by the evidence and is widely useful in a 
variety of practical applications (e.g., Einstein’s relativity)—does not require 
modification to continue to be valid. Quant researchers, by contrast, have 
no choice but to conduct ongoing research and to take every measure to 
ensure that their research output is prolific. This is because, though nature 
is relatively stable, the markets are not. Whether from regulatory changes, 
the changing whims of the aggregate psychology of investors and traders, 
the constant competition for alpha among traders, or whatever other phe-
nomena, the markets are in fact highly dynamic processes. For this reason, 
quant traders must constantly conduct research so that they can evolve with 
as much rigor and forethought as they used in developing their original 
strategies.
i dea Generation
Ideally, quants follow the scientific method in their research. In this regard, 
the development of theories (or theoretically sound approaches to data min-
ing) is the first key step in the research process. We find four common sourc-
es of ideas to be observations of the markets, academic literature, migration, 
and lessons from the activities of discretionary traders.
The main way that quants come up with their own ideas is by watching 
the markets. This approach most directly embodies the spirit of the scientific 
method. An excellent example comes from the history of the oldest of quant 
trading strategies: trend following in futures contracts. Richard Donchian 
is the father of trend following. He originally traded stocks, but in 1948, 
he created Futures, Inc., the first publicly held commodity fund. In Decem-
ber 1960, he published his philosophy toward trading in his newsletter , 
Commodity Trend Timing.
1 He observed that there are sweeping moves in 
many markets that folks tend to call bull or bear markets; he postulated that 
one could build a system that would detect that these trends had begun and 
then ride the wave. He translated his philosophy into the following strategy: 
If a given market’s price is above the highest closing price over the past two 
weeks, buy that market. If its price goes below the lowest closing price over 
the past two weeks, sell that market short. In the meantime, hold whatever 
position you have in that market. Using this incredibly simple system, from

1950 to 1970 he built a successful track record and spawned an industry 
that now manages hundreds of billions of dollars.
The academic literature in quantitative finance, and finance more gener-
ally, is replete with papers on a massive array of topics of interest to quant 
researchers. For example, many finance papers have been written on clever 
ways in which corporate chief finance officers (CFOs) attempt to fudge their 
companies’ earnings and other financial figures to retain the confidence of 
shareholders. Quant firms have taken note, and several now have strate-
gies in their arsenal that look for the kinds of behaviors described in the 
academic literature for trading opportunities. Many quant firms spend sig-
nificant time scouring academic journals, working papers, and conference 
presentations to glean ideas that can be tested using the scientific method. 
Such a quant could find papers on topics such as the management of finan-
cial statements and could test ideas learned from these papers. Perhaps the 
most classic example of an academic paper that made massive waves in the 
quant trading community is Harry Markowitz’s paper , modestly entitled 
“Portfolio Selection. ” As discussed in Chapter 6, in “Portfolio Selection,” 
Dr . Markowitz proposed an algorithm to compute the “optimal” portfolio 
using a technique called mean variance optimization. For all the research 
that has been done on portfolio construction over the decades since Dr . 
Markowitz’s paper was published, his technique and variants of it remain 
key tools in the toolbox of quant trading. Aside from the literature in finance, 
quants also frequently utilize the literature from other scientific fields—such 
as astronomy, physics, or psychology—for ideas that might be applicable to 
quant finance problems.
Another common source of new ideas is via the migration of a research-
er or portfolio manager from one quant shop to the next. Though many 
firms attempt to make this more difficult via noncompete and nondisclosure 
agreements, quants can effectively take ideas from one place to another , 
and this is to be expected. Any rational quant would want to know what 
the competition are doing, particularly those who are successful. At least 
part of the attraction of a potential new hire who has worked elsewhere 
must be the prospect of learning about the activities, and maybe even some 
secrets, of competitors. There are countless examples of this sort of thing. 
Goldman Sachs gave birth to AQR’s quantitative approach to global tactical 
asset allocation and global equity market‐neutral trading. Richard Dennis 
trained a group of new traders called the Turtles, none of whom had any 
trading experience, in trend following as a social experiment and to settle 
a bet with his friend William Eckhardt. D. E. Shaw was created after its 
founder cut his teeth at Morgan Stanley’s statistical arbitrage prop trad-
ing desk and has itself spawned several successful alumni, including Two 
Sigma and Highbridge’s quantitative equity manager . In a fascinating case, 

## Page 171

Research 151
Renaissance Technologies, famous for its ability to retain talent partly by 
having its researchers sign iron‐clad noncompete agreements, once lost two 
of its researchers to Millennium Partners. Renaissance sued Millennium 
over the incident, and it turned out that the researchers had somehow man-
aged not to sign the noncompete agreements while at Renaissance. None-
theless, the traders were ultimately terminated by Millennium, who simply 
decided that retaining them was more trouble than it was worth. Sometimes, 
investors who have peeked behind the curtains as part of their assessment 
of a given quant shop, and then shared what they’ve seen with others, act as 
the carriers of ideas from one quant shop to the next.
Finally, quants learn lessons from the behavior of successful discretion-
ary traders. For example, an old adage among successful traders is “Ride 
winners and cut losers. ” This idea can easily be formalized and tested and 
has come to be known as a stop‐loss policy, which involves systematically 
realizing losses on positions that are not working out. There are many ex-
amples of quants working closely with successful discretionary traders in an 
attempt to codify aspects of the latter’s behavior into a trading system. Not 
all are necessarily bound for success. Technical trader is the label applied 
to a trader who subjectively analyzes graphs of market prices and makes 
decisions based on “rules” about the implications of various shapes of such 
graphs. These shapes are given names such as a head and shoulders pattern 
or an upward triangle pattern. Many quant funds have come and (mostly) 
gone that have attempted to re-create such patterns into systematic trading 
rules. This could be because the idea itself is not based on valid theory, or 
it might be because the human version is ultimately less rule based, as one 
might like to believe, condemning a truly systematic implementation to be 
unsuccessful. However , even here valuable lessons can be learned: Not all 
successful traders have skill, and a helpful way to begin figuring out what 
really works and doesn’t is to put an idea through the grinder of a research 
process and see if it’s still alive at the end.

The process of testing is central to research. At first glance, the most com-
mon version of this process looks fairly simple. First, build a model and train 
it on some subset of the data available (the in‐sample period). Then test it on 
another subset of the data to see if it is profitable (the out‐of‐sample period). 
However , research is an activity that is fraught with peril. The researcher is 
constantly offered opportunities to forgo rigor in favor of wishful thinking. 
In this section, we address some of the work and challenges inherent in the 
research process.

In quant trading, models are approximations of the world. They are used to 
predict the future using data as inputs. The first part of the testing process 
is to train a model by finding optimal parameters over an in‐sample period. 
That sounds rather like a mouthful of marbles, so let’s walk through it term 
by term.
Let’s imagine that we want to test the idea that cheap stocks outperform 
expensive stocks. We even theorize that the metric we will use to define 
cheapness is the earnings yield (earnings/price), such that a higher earnings 
yield implies a cheaper stock. But what level of yield is sufficiently high to 
cause us to think that the stock will outperform? And what level of earn-
ings yield is sufficiently low to imply that a stock is expensive and is likely 
to underperform? These levels are parameters. In general the parameters of 
a model are quantities that define some aspect of a model and can affect 
its performance. These are variables that can be set at whatever level one 
chooses, and by varying these levels, the model itself is altered and will pro-
vide different results.
Imagine that you hire a consultant to help you buy the ideal “optimal” 
house. The consultant lists all the relevant variables that might factor into 
your decision, things like the size of the house, its condition at the time of 
purchase, and the location and school district. If you do not tell him your 
ideal levels for each of these variables, he can deduce them by observing 
your reaction to various houses. A big house in a poor neighborhood might 
generate a lukewarm reaction, whereas a smaller house in a good neighbor-
hood might generate a higher degree of interest for you. In this way, the 
consultant can deduce that you dislike the first neighborhood and prefer the 
second, and furthermore that the neighborhood might be more important 
to you than the size of the house. If he is able to repeat these “experiments,” 
he can continue to fine‐tune the choices he presents to you until he finds the 
house that matches your desires optimally. T o the extent he succeeds in this 
endeavor , he has performed well.
In this way, optimal parameters in a quant model are those that lead 
to the best performance based on whatever metrics one chooses to use to 
measure goodness. Training a model involves simply finding the optimal pa-
rameter set, which is usually accomplished by trying a number of them and 
hoping that at least one set comes out looking appealing. What constitutes 
appeal is a matter we will discuss in some detail forthwith, but first we con-
sider some other aspects of in‐sample research.
In‐sample research is, in a sense, fun for a quant. In the real world, the 
quant’s model is constantly buffeted by new information and unpredictable 
events. But the historical data from the in‐sample period are known to the 

## Page 173

Research 153
model in their entirety, and nothing about them needs to be predicted. The 
in‐sample period is like the answer key to a test in grade school. It is the 
model’s best chance to work, because it doesn’t have to predict anything. 
The model simply has to do a reasonable job of explaining the in‐sample 
period after the fact, with the whole picture available for review. This is the 
one part of the research process in which there is a high degree of hope.
An important decision lies in the process of in‐sample testing: What 
exactly constitutes the sample chosen for fitting the model? A sample is 
characterized by two things: its breadth and its length. Imagine that a re-
searcher plans to build a strategy to trade the approximately 5,000 listed 
U.S. stocks and that she has at her disposal data starting in 1990 and end-
ing now. As far as the breadth of the in‐sample test, the researcher must 
choose how many of the stocks to use and decide how to choose the ones 
that are used. Should she use a broad cross‐section of stocks across sectors 
and capitalization levels? Should she use a narrower cross‐section, or should 
she choose all the stocks? As to length of time, the researcher must consider 
what window of data will be available to use for fitting the model. Will it be 
the most recent data or the oldest data? Will it be a random set of smaller 
time windows or the entire set of data from 1990 onward? The most com-
mon preference among quants would be to use all the instruments for some 
subset of the time, but this is by no means universal, since there is a trade‐off 
here to consider .
By using more data, the quant has a broader array of scenarios and 
market events that the model has to fit itself to, which can help make it 
more robust. By the time it has to succeed in real conditions, it has already 
“seen” and been adapted to the scenarios and environments found in the 
large in‐sample period. On the other hand, the more data the model is al-
lowed to see while it is being tuned, the greater the risk of creating a model 
that is nothing more than a good explanation of the past. For this reason, 
many quants utilize a reasonable cross‐section of the data for the purpose of 
in‐sample testing and model fitting.
What Constitutes a “Good” Model?
Quants utilize a wide variety of metrics to determine the “goodness” of 
a model. This is true for both the in‐sample part of the process and the 
out‐of‐sample part of the process, the latter of which we discuss in the next 
section. I include here a number of statistics (and other output) that quants 
may use. I illustrate these metrics using a strategy for forecasting the S&P 
500. It has a one‐day horizon for its forecast, and it uses an adjustment to 
a well‐known idea known as the equity risk premium, which is calculated 
by taking the difference between the earnings yield of the S&P 500 and the 

## Page 174

154  Ins I de the Black Box
10‐year Treasury note each day. If the S&P’s yield is higher than the bond’s, 
this is viewed as a signal to be long stocks. If the S&P’s yield is lower than 
the bond’s, this is a signal to be short stocks. I built this strategy back in the 
mid‐1990s for tactical asset allocation purposes, but I have never traded it, 
for reasons that will be obvious after we assess it using these metrics. It is 
shown simply as a way of illustrating the kinds of tests that a strategy is re-
quired to pass before being implemented in the real world, with real money. 
The results I show for the strategy are based on daily closing prices from 
June 1982 through December 2000.

A graph indicating the cumulative 
profits over time is one of the most powerful pieces of output in a testing 
process because, as they say, one picture is worth a thousand words. From 
a graph of cumulative profits, you can see whether the strategy would have 
made money, how smoothly, and with what sort of downside risk, just to 
name a few things. As you can see in Exhibit 9.1, the S&P strategy shows 
as being profitable over the test period, but its return stream is very lumpy, 
characterized by long periods of inactivity (several years, in some cases), 
some sharp losses, and some very steep gains. Immediately a researcher can 
see that this strategy has some real problems. Is it realistic to want to sit on 
the sidelines making almost no trades, and certainly no profits, from late 
1989 until early 1995?

a verage r ate of r eturn  The average rate of return indicates how well the 
strategy actually worked (i.e., how much it might have made) in the past. 
If it didn’t work in the testing phase, it’s very unlikely to work in real life. 
As we will see later , testing offers many opportunities for the researcher to 
believe that making money in trading is a trivially easy exercise. Sadly, this 
misperception is mainly due to a wide variety of deadly traps. In our S&P 
500 example, the total cumulative profits in the simulation were 746 per -
cent, which comes to an average annual rate of return of 12.1 percent before 
any transaction costs or fees.
Variability of 
r
eturns over 
t
ime
 
The variability of returns over time, which 
describes the uncertainty around the average returns, is helpful in decid -
ing whether the strategy is worth owning. In general, the less the vari -
ability for a given level of returns, the better a strategy is considered to 
be. For example, if a strategy averages 20 percent returns per year , with 
an annual standard deviation of 2 percent (i.e., 67 percent of the time, 
the annual rate of return should fall within +/–2 percent of the average 
20 percent figure, or between 18 and 22 percent), this would be a better 
outcome than if the same 20 percent average annual return came with 
20 percent annual standard deviation (i.e., 67 percent of the time, re -
turns are within 0 and 40 percent). The idea is that one can have more 
confidence in a given return if the uncertainty around it is low, and more 
confidence is a good thing.
At my shop, we look at a statistic we dubbed lumpiness, which is the 
portion of a strategy’s total return that comes from periods that are sig-
nificantly above average. This is another way of measuring consistency of 
returns. Despite the importance of this metric, it is not always the case that 
consistency should be a primary goal. Nevertheless, it is good to know what 
to expect as an investor in or practitioner of a strategy, if for no other rea-
son than to discern when the strategy’s behavior is changing. In our S&P 
500 strategy, the annualized standard deviation of its daily returns over the 
entire test period was 21.2 percent.
Worst 
p
eak-to-Valley 
d
rawdown(s)
 
This metric measures the maximum de -
cline from any cumulative peak in the profit curve. If a strategy makes 
10 percent, then declines 15 percent, then makes another 15 percent, the 
total compounded return for this period is about +7.5 percent. Howev -
er , the peak‐to‐valley drawdown is –15 percent. Another way of stating 
this is that the investor had to risk 15 percent to make 7.5 percent. The 
lower the drawdown of a strategy, the better . Many quants measure not 
just one drawdown but several, to get a sense of both the extreme and 
more routine downside historical risks of their strategies. It is also typical 

## Page 176

156  Ins I de the Black Box
to measure recovery times after drawdowns, which give the researcher a 
sense of the model’s behavior after it’s done poorly. Long recovery times 
are generally disliked because they imply that the strategy will remain in 
negative territory for quite a while if it does go into a large drawdown at 
some point. The S&P 500 strategy’s worst peak‐to‐valley drawdown in 
the back‐test was –39.7 percent, and it came from being short the S&P 
500 in the summer of 1987, before the crash in October actually made 
that trade look good.
Drawdown information must be handled with care, however . If 
we were to look at the returns of a convertible bond arbitrage strategy 
from 1990 through 1997, eight years of data (which is considered a long 
track record in the hedge fund business) would show you very limited 
drawdowns. But in 1998, these strategies were badly hurt. The problem 
was sample bias , which means that the sample we used to determine the 
“worst” drawdown was not a fair representation of the whole array of 
possible outcomes. Rather , even though it was “long,” it covered a period 
that was almost entirely favorable to this strategy, which would lead to 
an underappreciation of the potential downside risks. There’s not a great 
solution to this problem: Either the sample over which the drawdown 
was computed is sufficiently large as to cover a large range of market re -
gimes and both favorable and unfavorable environments (specifically as it 
relates to the strategy being tested), or it doesn’t. If the sample cannot be 
made larger and more representative of all possibilities (the population, 
in stats‐speak), then the quant can only exercise some judgment about 
how much worse things could look if the environment did turn ugly. This 
is self‐evidently an exercise that depends heavily on the judgment of the 
researcher , and even then is at best a ballpark figure.
Furthermore, the worst historical drawdown is merely one potential 
path that even this biased sample could have produced. Imagine that the 
historical return distribution of a strategy is like a deck of cards. If we turn 
the cards over in the order that they are already placed in the deck, we get 
the historical time series. If, however , we shuffle the deck and then turn the 
cards over in this new order , we get a different time series from the same re-
turn distribution. If we do this over and over , thousands of times, we will get 
many theoretically possible paths from one actual history. This practice is 
known as resampling, and it is done to boost the power of a historical sam-
ple. With these thousands of resampled histories, we can compute the worst 
drawdown(s) of each one, and have a more robust estimate of the potential 
downside risk of a strategy. It is therefore a sensible practice to recognize 
again that the deck itself contains only a subset of all the cards that might 
one day be dealt to us. It may, we worry, contain too many aces and kings, 
and not enough twos and threes.

p redictive p ower  A statistic known as the R‐squared (R2) shows how much 
of the variability of the thing being predicted can be accounted for by the 
thing you’re using to predict it, or , in other words, how much of the vari -
ability in the target is explained by the signal. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, 
and there are a couple of valid ways to compute it. That said, most statisti-
cal packages (including Microsoft Excel) can compute an R 2 with minimal 
effort on the part of the user . A value of 1 implies that the predictor is 
explaining 100 percent of the variability of the thing being predicted. In 
case it’s not already clear , when we talk about “the thing being predicted,” 
we are of course referring to a stock or a futures contract or some other 
financial instrument that we want to trade. In quant finance, we’re literally 
trying to predict the future prices/returns/directions of such instruments, 
making an R
2 of 1 basically impossible, unless methodological errors are 
being made. In fact, a superb R 2 in our industry is 0.05 (out of sample, to 
be discussed later in this chapter). A former employee of mine once said, 
“If you see an R 2 above 0.15 and it’s not because you made a mistake, 
run the other way, because the SEC will arrest you for insider trading if 
you use it. ” Note that an R
2 of 0.15 implies that some predictor describes 
15 percent of the future variability of the target of the forecast. As another 
quant trader put it, “People have gotten rich off a 0.02 R 2. ” Exhibit 9.2 
shows that the R 2 of the S&P 500 strategy was less than 0.01 from 1982 
through 2000.

Quants frequently utilize an additional approach to ascertaining predic-
tive power . This approach involves bucketing the returns of the instruments 
included in the test by the deciles (or any other quantile preferred by the 
researcher) of the underlying forecasts. In general, a model with reliable 
predictive power is one that demonstrates that the worst returns are found 
in the bucket for which the worst returns are expected, with each successive 
bucket of improving expected returns in fact performing better than the 
prior bucket. If the returns of the instruments being forecast are not monot-
onically improving with the forecast of them, it could be an indication that 
the strategy is working purely by accident.
A bar chart showing the quintile study for the S&P 500 strategy is 
shown in Exhibit 9.3. As you can see, in this study at least, the strategy 
looks reasonable. The leftmost bucket of signals coincides with an av -
erage return in the S&P 500 (on the subsequent day) of –2.35 percent, 
and indeed, this is the worst average S&P return of any of the buckets. 
The second bucket from the left shows that the S&P 500 strategy’s sec -
ond‐most‐bearish group of forecasts for the S&P averages –0.19 percent. 
As we move to increasingly bullish signals, the S&P’s returns continue to 
improve in accordance with the bullishness of the forecasts, which is what 
one would hope for . The fact that each bucket’s average return is better 
than the one previous to it is said to imply a monotonic relationship be -
tween our alpha signal (the modified equity risk premium signal described 
earlier) and the target of our forecasts (the S&P 500 index’s return over 
the next day).

p ercentage Winning t rades or Winning t ime p eriods  This percentage is another 
measure of consistency. It tells the researcher whether the system tends to 
make its profits from a small portion of the trades that happened to do 
very well or from a large number of trades, each of which might contribute 
only modestly to the bottom line. Similarly, one can easily measure the total 
number of winning (positive) periods versus the total number of periods. 
(This is most often measured by percentage winning, or profitable, days.) 
In both cases, one tends to have more confidence in strategies with greater 
consistency. In the S&P strategy, the results of this study are somewhat unu-
sual in that the strategy is not designed to produce a signal every day but 
instead only when the model perceives that the opportunity is sufficiently 
attractive to warrant trading at all. As such, the model produces a zero sig-
nal 65 percent of the time. It produces winning trades about 19 percent of 
the time and losing trades about 16 percent of the time. Of the days when it 
actually has a nonzero signal, it wins approximately 54 percent of the time. 
This, too, is not a terrible outcome for a strategy.

A great many statistics have been pro-
posed as useful measures of risk‐adjusted return, which are generally all at-
tempts to measure the “cost” (in terms of risk) of achieving some return. The 
canonical example is the Sharpe ratio, named after William Sharpe (men-
tioned earlier in connection with the Nobel Prize in Economics he shared 
with Harry Markowitz in 1990). The Sharpe ratio is computed by taking the 
average periodic return above the risk‐free rate and dividing this quantity 
by the periodic variability of returns. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better . 
Quants (and many in the investment management business) have shortened 
this moniker by dropping the word ratio. A strategy with a 2 Sharpe is a 
strategy that delivers two percentage points of return (above the risk‐free 
rate) for each point of variability (and this is a rather good Sharpe, if you 
can get it).
A close cousin of the Sharpe ratio is the information ratio, which is dif-
ferent from the Sharpe only in that it eliminates the risk‐free rate from the 
formula. The information ratio of the S&P 500 timing strategy is a mere 
0.57, meaning that the investor receives 0.57 percent in return for every 
1 percent in risk taken (again, before transaction costs and before any other 
fees or costs of implementing the strategy). The Sterling ratio (average return 
divided by the variability of below‐average returns), the Calmar ratio (aver-
age return divided by the worst peak‐to‐valley drawdown), and the Omega 
ratio (the sum of all positive returns divided by the sum of all negative re-
turns) are also widely used among a number of other risk‐adjusted return 
metrics. The S&P 500 strategy from 1982 through 2000 displayed a Sterling 
ratio of 0.87, a Calmar ratio of 0.31, and an Omega ratio of 1.26. Of these

ratios, the most discouraging is the low Calmar ratio, which indicates that 
the strategy generated only 0.31 percent in returns for every 1 percentage 
point of drawdown it experienced.

Many quants utilize several kinds of strat -
egies at once. As such, the quant is effectively managing a portfolio of 
strategies , which can be thought of much like any other kind of portfolio 
in that diversification is desirable. The quant frequently measures how a 
proposed new idea will fit in with other , already utilized, ideas, to ensure 
that the new strategy is in fact adding value. After all, a good idea that 
doesn’t improve a portfolio is not ultimately useful. Though it is com -
mon to compute a correlation coefficient between the new idea and the 
existing portfolio of strategies, many quants measure the value‐added of 
a new strategy by comparing the results of the existing strategy with and 
without the new idea. A significant improvement in the results indicates 
that there is a synergistic relationship between the new idea and the exist -
ing strategy.

In testing a strategy, one interesting question to ask is, how 
sensitive is this strategy to getting information in a timely manner , and for 
how long is the forecast effect sustained in the marketplace? Many quants 
will seek to understand what their strategies’ returns would be if they 
must initiate trades on a lagged basis after they receive a trading signal. 
In other words, if a strategy initiated a signal to sell Microsoft (MSFT) 
on April 28, 2006, the quant can see what the performance of his strategy 
would be in MSFT if it was not allowed to sell MSFT for one day, two 
days, three days, and so on. In this way, he can determine his strategy’s 
sensitivity to the timeliness with which information is received, and he can 
also gain some information about how crowded the strategy is (because 
more crowding would mean sharper movements to a new equilibrium, i.e., 
faster degradation of profit potential). Imagine that a researcher develops 
a strategy to trade stocks in response to changes in recommendations by 
Wall Street analysts. Increases in the level of analysts’ consensus recom -
mendations for a company lead to a targeted long position in that com -
pany, whereas deterioration in the aggregate recommendation level would 
lead to a targeted short position in the company. This strategy is popular 
and followed by many quants (and discretionary traders). However , its 
effects are very short‐lived and are very sensitive to the timing of the in -
formation received.
An example of this phenomenon is shown in Exhibit 9.4, using MSFT 
from April through October 2006. As you can see, there were five down-
grades on April 28, which caused MSFT to underperform the S&P 500 by 

## Page 181

Research 161
about 11.4 percent on the day the downgrades were announced. In fact, the 
opening price of MSFT on the 28th was already down about 11.1 percent 
because the downgrades all took place before the market opened. As such, 
the quant trader must be careful not to allow his simulation to assume 
that he was able to transact in MSFT early enough to capture any of the 
11.1 percent change. Instead, to be conservative, he can test what his, say, 
two‐week performance on the trade would have been if he initiated the 
trade on various days after the initial ratings change.
If he did this, what he would find is that if he sold MSFT at any time 
after the close of April 27 (the night before the recommendation changes 
were announced), his trade would have actually been pretty mediocre. He 
would have made money selling MSFT at the close on April 28, May 1 (the 
next business day), or May 2, but from May 3 through May 12 the trade 
would have been unprofitable. This illustrates the importance of stress‐
 
testing a strategy’s dependence on timely information, which might not al-
ways be available.
Interestingly, delaying the signal’s implementation does not always 
result in a negative outcome. For example, our S&P strategy tends to be

“early” on its trades, that is, it tends to be short too early and long too early, 
even though the market subsequently does move in the direction forecast, 
on average. As such, delaying its entry by merely one day dramatically im-
proves the total return of the strategy, from 746 percent total (12.1 percent 
annualized) to 870 percent total (12.9 percent annualized). This does not 
necessarily bode well for the use of such a strategy. In general, it is not com-
forting to know that you get a signal from your trading strategy that you 
not only can go without implementing for a little while (which would be the 
better result) but that you actually are better off ignoring for at least a full 
day after you get the signal.

It was mentioned earlier that parameters 
can be varied, and by varying them, differing outcomes are likely. But much 
can be learned about the quality of a strategy based on how much the out-
comes vary as a result of small changes in the parameters. Let’s use our P/E‐
based strategy from earlier as an example. Imagine that we think that any 
P/E ratio that is either above 50 or negative (because of negative earnings) 
should be considered expensive. Meanwhile, we presume that any P/E ratio 
below 12 is cheap. Assume we test the strategy according to the previously 
discussed metrics and find that a low P/E strategy with these parameters 
(≥50 implies expensive, ≤12 implies cheap) delivers a 10 percent annual 
return and 15 percent annual variability.
Now imagine that we vary the parameters only slightly so that any 
stock with a P/E ratio below 11 is cheap and any with a P/E ratio that is 
negative or above 49 is expensive. If this version of the strategy, with slightly 
differing parameters, results in a significantly different outcome from the 
first example, we should mistrust both results and use neither in our model. 
This is because the model has proven to be overly sensitive to a small change 
in the values of the parameters, which makes little real‐world sense. Should 
there be any great difference between a 10 P/E and an 11 P/E, or between a 
50 P/E and a 49 P/E? What many researchers look for is smoothness of the 
goodness of outcomes with respect to parameter values. Near‐neighboring 
sets of parameters should result in fairly similar results, and if they don’t, a 
researcher should be a bit suspicious about them, because such results may 
indicate overfitting.
o verfitting
The previously described metrics represent a sampling of the kinds that 
quants use to determine whether a given model is good. These metrics are 
used to judge the quality of a model, both while it is being created and when 

## Page 183

Research 163
it is being used. Indeed, many hedge fund investors look at the majority of 
these metrics as ways of gauging the performance of various traders.
There remains, however , one more extremely important guiding prin-
ciple in determining the goodness of a quant strategy, and this is an abso-
lute terror of overfitting. Overfitting a model essentially implies that the 
researcher is asking too much of the data. The more classical definition is 
that a researcher has built a model that closely explains the past, but which 
is a poor guide to the future. This can happen in several ways.
First, the researcher must be careful about the complexity of a model. 
Complexity in a model can come from a couple of sources. One is the number 
of predictive factors. In building a model, a researcher could include thousands 
of factors to explain the past fluctuations in asset prices. This model could 
more or less explain exactly what has happened in the past. But let us recall 
that the goal of quant trading models, like the goal of any alpha‐seeking trader , 
is to predict the future, not to explain the past. And while we all expect the 
past to provide some guidance as to the future, we also must understand that 
the past is, at best, an imperfect guide to the future. This in turn implies that 
to perfectly explain the past is not necessarily useful in predicting the future.
Second, a researcher can create a very complex model in terms of the 
conditionalities utilized. For example, one might conceive of a strategy that 
looks for a specific pattern of price behavior in order to determine a long 
or short position. A simple model might call for a long position to be initi-
ated in an instrument if that instrument is up more than some amount over 
the past 10 days. A more complex model might call for the long position 
to be initiated if the instrument is down over the past one day, up over the 
past 10 days, down over the past 20 days, and up over the past 100 days. 
Of course, as humans, we’re great at rationalizing things, so we might be 
able to come up with some explanation for why such a strategy is definitely 
going to work. But it is unequivocally complex, in that there are many “if” 
statements embedded in it. As such, it is very fragile.
The desire for relatively simple models for use in forecasting is known 
as parsimony. Parsimony is derived from the Latin word parsimonia, mean-
ing sparingness and frugality. Among quants, parsimony implies caution in 
arriving at a hypothesis. This concept is absolutely central to the research 
process in quant trading. Models that are parsimonious utilize as few as-
sumptions and as much simplicity as possible in attempting to explain the 
future. As such, models with large numbers of parameters or factors are gen-
erally to be viewed with skepticism, especially given the risks of overfitting.
Parsimony has its roots in a famous principle of a Franciscan friar and lo-
gician, William of Occam, known as Occam’s razor. Occam’s razor is roughly 
translated from the original Latin as follows: Entities must not be multiplied 
beyond necessity . In science, this has been understood to mean that it is better 

## Page 184

164  Ins I de the Black Box
to use as few assumptions, and as simple a theory , as possible to explain the 
observations. Karl Popper pointed out in 1992 that simpler theories are better 
because they are more easily tested, which means that they contain more em-
pirical value. All around, scientists agree that parsimony , the stripping away of 
unnecessary assumptions and complexity , is simply better science. Einstein’s 
saying, quoted at the beginning of this chapter , adds an important caveat, 
which is that oversimplifying an explanation is not helpful either .
Looking again at our example of the consultant hired to help you buy a 
house: If he adds a large number of factors to the mix, such as the color of 
the guest bathroom tiles or the type of roofing material, given that there is no 
reason to believe ex ante that such factors are priorities for you as his client, 
his analysis would become muddled and confused. The complex model (in 
terms of number of factors) might do a decent job of explaining your past be-
havior , but it is unlikely to do an excellent job of predicting whether you’ll like 
a house you haven’t already seen, because it is unlikely all the factors included 
are actually important in ascertaining your preferences in a house. On the 
other hand, if the agent uses only two factors—say , the size of the house and 
its school district—this model might not do a good job of predicting your pref-
erences because it leaves out too many important variables, like the number 
of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the condition of the property , the size 
of the lot, and so on. Just so, an important part of the quant researcher’s job is 
balancing on the tightrope between trying to explain the past too perfectly and 
trying to explain it too little. T o one side is failure due to overcomplicating the 
model and to the other is failure due to oversimplifying it.
A related type of overfitting can be seen in strategies that trade only ex-
tremely infrequently . Here, we are concerned with the problem that a small 
number of trades, no matter how profitable, is unlikely to provide strong sta-
tistical significance. For example, imagine a model that buys the S&P 500 any 
time it has a drawdown of at least 40 percent, and buy the S&P back again 
when it reaches a new high. We will see a strong backtest for this strategy if we 
run one. This strategy would have enormous profits and relatively small draw-
downs. But it also would see exactly three trading signals in the past 40 years! It 
is hard to get too excited about anything that occurs once every 13 years, and it 
is certainly risky to put any serious amount of capital at risk in such a strategy .
Another common source of potential overfitting risk comes from the spec-
ification of parameters. As a reminder , in Chapter 3, we discussed the fact that 
many models have parameters. For example, in constructing a trend model, a 
researcher is making the claim that some characteristic of the change in price 
over some period in the past is indicative of a likely future continuation of 
that move. There are several parameters one could imagine being relevant to 
such a model. For example, what is the historical period over which the price 
change is computed (this is known as lookback in quant circles)? If there is a 

## Page 185

Research 165
minimum size for such a move to be considered significant, what is that mini-
mum size? These questions are not central to the definition of the model, but 
different answers to these questions can nonetheless have significant impact 
on the returns that the model generates. For example, a trend model lookback 
of two days may generate returns that are completely uncorrelated to the re-
turns of the exact same trend model with a lookback of six months.
Quants can fix parameters in a few ways. One is to set them discre-
tionarily, based on a prior conviction about how the markets function. The 
results of a backtest will then indicate how much promise the strategy has. 
Such an approach has the benefit of not being fitted at all. It either works or 
it doesn’t. There are drawbacks to this approach, too, in that it relies heavily 
on the judgment of the researcher , and the optimal parameter value might 
lie reasonably far away from the one set in his model. That said, a researcher 
who has Bayesian tendencies (as discussed in Chapter 3) will likely be in-
clined to set parameters in this manner .
A second approach to parameter fitting is to have a part of the backtest 
show the results of the strategy historically over a variety of parameter val-
ues, and to select the parameters that optimize the “goodness” of the result. 
This decision can be subjective or it can be done by an algorithm that re-
flects some rule‐based approach to parameter selection. We now turn to a 
discussion of the considerations that apply to the selection of parameter 
values. Consider Exhibit 9.5.

Which of these points would you guess is the best choice for a param-
eter value? Choice A doesn’t look so good, because the strategy seems to do 
poorly when using such a parameter value. Choice C looks enticing because 
it is the highest point of a broad plateau. But it is so near a cliff’s edge that 
we cannot be sure whether we’re at risk of picking unwisely. Choice D seems 
to have the best outcome, but it is also fairly unreliable, since its near neigh-
bors are universally poor . This leaves Choice B as the best. Even though we 
haven’t picked the highest point on the plateau, we’ve picked one with a 
margin of safety around it on both sides. It bears discussing a bit about why 
this margin of safety is so important.
When we see a lonely peak like the one represented by Point D in 
Exhibit 9.5, it is likely that our testing has uncovered some spurious coinci-
dence in the fitting period that makes it especially favorable for that single 
parameter value. Unfortunately, it is likely that this coincidence will not 
persist into the future. By selecting Point D, in other words, we are implicitly 
betting that the future will look exactly like the past. You might be familiar 
with the standard performance disclaimer: “Past performance is not an in-
dication of future results. ” Yet we all tend to judge the success of a trader at 
least partly by performance, which is a way of saying that we think the past 
might actually be some indication of the future. Similarly, and based on the 
premises of scientific research in general, all quant trading (and indeed, all 
science) assumes implicitly that the past can have some value in helping us 
understand the future. This is why the scientific method starts with observa-
tions of the world that can be generalized into a theory. But the appropriate 
way to think about the past is as a general guide to the future, not as an 
exact copy. We build a model that is itself a generalized description of this 
general guide to the future, and when phrased this way, it is clear that we 
want our model to err on the side of caution. As such, sensible quants would 
refer to Point B as being more “robust” than Point D because Point B has a 
better chance of being good, but not solely as a result of some accident of 
the sample data used to find it.
One final note on parameter fitting is that parameters can either be fit 
once, or they can be fit repeatedly in the future, as new data are generated 
in the markets. The considerations described here apply to each instance 
of such a fitting of parameters. However , the act of repeatedly fitting pa-
rameters itself increases the complexity of a model. And, depending on ex-
actly how such a re‐fitting is implemented, this approach may also rely on 
fewer data than are desirable for an exercise so fraught with overfitting peril 
already.
This leads us directly to a final, important consideration in the subject 
of overfitting, one which we alluded to in Chapter 3. The fact is that capital 
markets generate an enormous amount of data. Firms like Renaissance are 

## Page 187

Research 167
famous for collecting terabytes of data each day. Merely capturing every 
message generated on every U.S. equity exchange requires more than one 
terabyte of data storage every day. However , the data are extremely noisy. 
Why capital markets are such a noisy process is a subject for philosophers 
and economists. But it is an undeniable fact that past data yield extremely 
little information about future fluctuations. This is the reason that a great 
out‐of‐sample r
2 is on the order of 0.04 (out‐of‐sample testing is the subject 
of the next section). There is just very little signal buried in all that noise. 
Something which, therefore, closely explains such a noisy process must be 
viewed with an extreme amount of skepticism.
Quant researchers must evaluate the theories they are testing. This is 
done using a wide array of measurements and techniques, but ultimately, a 
significant amount of discretion is used. It is unquestionably the case that 
what separates a successful researcher from the rest is good judgment about 
the kinds of issues raised in this chapter . As a general principle, we may note 
that good researchers must possess sufficient confidence and skill to believe 
that theories can be developed or improved on. At least as important, re-
searchers must also be skeptical and humble enough to know and be entirely 
at peace with the fact that most ideas simply don’t work.
o ut-of- s ample t esting
Out‐of‐sample testing, the second half of the testing process, is designed 
to tell the researcher whether her formalized theory actually works in real 
life, without the benefit of seeing the cheat sheet provided during in‐sample 
testing. The model’s parameters have by now been fixed using a different 
set of data (from the in‐sample testing period), and it’s simply a question 
of whether the model, with whatever parameters are chosen, really works 
in a new, out‐of‐sample data set. Many of the same kinds of statistics as 
described in this chapter are utilized to make this judgment.
One additional statistic many quants use is the ratio of the R
2 in the 
out‐of‐sample test to the R2 in the in‐sample test. This ratio is another way 
for the researcher to obtain a sense of the robustness of the model. If the out‐
of‐sample R2 is relatively close to the in‐sample R2 (i.e., if the ratio is about 
half or better), that is considered a good thing. If it is significantly smaller , 
the researcher must be suspicious about the prospects for his model’s success.
There are many approaches to out‐of‐sample testing. The simplest uti -
lizes all the data that were set aside from the in‐sample test. Some researchers 
utilize a rolling out‐of‐sample technique in which the single oldest data point 
is discarded and one new data point is added to both the fitting (in‐sample) 
and testing (out‐of‐sample) period. This process is repeated through the entire 
available sample of data. The rolling out‐of‐sample technique is thought to 

## Page 188

168  Ins I de the Black Box
help refresh the model over time so that it does not depend on a single set 
of tests that might have been run some years previously . However , depend-
ing on the circumstances, this approach can have the weakness of giving the 
model the benefit of constant knowledge of the recent past, which could re-
duce its robustness. This trade‐off is extremely subtle and can be debated in 
any individual instance, rendering impractical any general judgment about its 
effectiveness. Still another approach utilizes an ever‐growing window of data 
for ongoing out‐of‐sample testing as time passes and more data are collected.
Though the objective of out‐of‐sample testing is clearly valid, it turns 
out to be a rather tricky thing to do correctly. Imagine a researcher who 
completes the model fitting over the in‐sample data. Then, having a model 
that seems robust, the researcher tests it over the out‐of‐sample data. But 
the model fails to deliver a good result on this new data set. The researcher , 
already having invested a lot of time on the model, decides to examine the 
reasons for the model’s failure over the out‐of‐sample period and discovers 
that the environment changed between the in‐ and out‐of‐sample periods 
in such a way that the model was making losing trades during the latter . 
Having learned a useful lesson, the researcher goes back to the model and 
alters it to account for this new information. He refits the model in sample, 
and then retests it out of sample. And, lo and behold, it works much better .
Before we break out the champagne, however , we should consider what 
the researcher has just done. By learning from the out‐of‐sample data and 
using that information to train the model anew, he has effectively used up 
his out‐of‐sample data and has caused them effectively to become part of 
the in‐sample data set. In general, going back and forth between the in‐ and 
out‐of‐sample data is a terrible idea. This brings up a still more subtle issue, 
but one that is closely related.
Often we know enough about that happens in the capital markets dur-
ing the out‐of‐sample period that we tend to build models and select pa-
rameter sets that we believe are likely to work out of sample anyway. This 
sullies the purpose of an out‐of‐sample test because we are, in many re-
spects, looking ahead. For example, we can look back on the Internet bub-
ble of the late 1990s and know that the world and the economy in fact did 
not change and that negative earnings should not be wildly rewarded in the 
long run. If we build a strategy today, we can know that it is possible for the 
Internet bubble to happen but that it eventually bursts. However , we could 
not have known this with certainty in 1999.
The world finds new and interesting ways to confound our understanding. 
As such, to test our current best thinking against competition that existed 
in the past is a form of wishful thinking. This is a subtle and nefarious form 
of look‐ahead bias, which is a critical problem in research. As researchers 
become more and more familiar with the out‐of‐sample periods they use 

## Page 189

Research 169
to test their ideas’ validity, it becomes more likely that they are implicitly 
assuming they would have known more about the future than in fact they 
would have known had they been asking the same questions historically. 
This practice is called burning data by some quants.
T o mitigate the data‐burning form of look‐ahead bias, some quant shops 
take reasonably drastic measures, separating the strategy research function 
from the strategy selection function and withholding a significant portion of 
the entire database from the researchers. In this way , the researcher , in theory , 
cannot even see what data he has and doesn’t have, making it much more dif-
ficult for him to engage in look‐ahead activities. With less draconian restric-
tions, the researcher might simply not be allowed to know or see what data 
are used for the out‐of‐sample period, or the portions of data used for in‐ and 
out‐of‐sample testing might be varied randomly or without informing the 
researcher . Regardless, as you can easily see, the problem of doing testing is 
tricky and requires great forethought if there is to be any hope of success.
Another approach is to determine that out‐of‐sample testing is a bit of a 
myth in the first place, especially for any experienced, observant researcher . As 
a result, out‐of‐sample testing is forgone in favor of a combination of extra 
vigilance regarding the in‐sample results, coupled with a minimum of param-
eter fitting. In this methodology , the quant uses as few parameters as possible, 
sets the values at some reasonable level, and simply tests the strategy and looks 
for all those metrics of good performance to have sufficiently high readings.
a ssumptions of t esting
Another component in the testing process revolves around the assumptions 
one makes about trading a strategy that is being tested historically. We dis-
cuss two examples here: transaction costs and (for equity market‐neutral or 
long/short strategies) short availability.
We have already discussed transaction costs, of which there are several 
components: commissions and fees, slippage, and market impact. Interest-
ingly, during the research process there is no empirical evidence of what a 
trading strategy would actually have cost to implement in the past. This is 
because the trading strategy wasn’t actually active in the past but is being 
researched in the present using historical market data. Therefore, the re-
searcher must make some assumption(s) about how much his order would 
really have cost in terms of market impact.
These assumptions can prove critical in determining whether a strat -
egy is good or bad. Let’s again look at an extreme case to understand why . 
Imagine that we assume that transactions are entirely costless. This might 
make a very high‐frequency trading strategy extremely appealing because, as 
long as it accurately predicts any movement in price, no matter how small, it 

## Page 190

170  Ins I de the Black Box
will seem to have been worthwhile to trade. Imagine that a model is correct 
55 percent of the time and makes $0.01 per share when it is correct. It loses 
45 percent of the time and loses $0.01 per share when it is wrong. So, for 
every 100 shares it trades, it could be expected to generate $0.10. But when 
it is implemented, it turns out that transactions actually cost $0.01 per share 
across all the components of cost, on average. This would imply that the 
strategy is actually breakeven on 55 percent of its trades (theoretical profit 
of $0.01 per share, less the cost of transacting each share of $0.01) and loses 
$0.02 per share on 45 percent of its trades. As a result, rather than making 
$0.10 per 100 shares, it is in fact losing $0.90, which is obviously a poor out-
come. Stated generally , overestimating transaction costs will cause a quant to 
hold positions for longer than is likely optimal, whereas underestimating 
transaction costs will cause a quant to turn over his portfolio too quickly and 
therefore bleed from the excess costs of transactions. If we have to err in this 
regard, it makes more sense to overestimate cost than to underestimate, but 
it is always preferable to get the cost estimation approximately right.
The second kind of assumption a quant must make in testing a market‐
neutral or long/short strategy in equities relates to the availability of short 
positions. Imagine a U.S. market‐neutral quant trader who, by design, holds 
a short portfolio that is roughly equal in size to the long portfolio. Over time, 
the short portfolio adds a significant amount of value by finding overpriced 
stocks and by making money when the stock market tumbles, thereby reduc-
ing the risk inherent in the strategy . However , it turns out that the names the 
strategy wants to short, and in particular , the most successful short picks, 
are on hard‐to‐borrow lists. Hard‐to‐borrow lists are those stocks that are 
generally restricted from shorting by the broker , because the broker cannot 
mechanically locate shares to borrow , which is required in the act of short-
ing. If the shares cannot be located, the trade would be considered a naked 
short sale, which is illegal in the United States. Therefore, the trade wouldn’t 
have been executed as expected by the back‐test. If the model is ignorant of 
hard‐to‐borrow issues (and making a model aware of this issue in the past is 
not trivial, since such historical data are hard to come by), the researcher can 
easily be fooled into thinking that the short portfolio will be able to deliver 
value that is, in reality , nonexistent. This is because when he goes to imple-
ment the live portfolio, he finds that he is unable to put on the best short 
trades and is forced to replace these with inferior short trades instead.

We have only scratched the surface of the work that a quant must do in re-
search, and must do well, to succeed over time. Research is a highly sensitive

area within the quant’s process. It is where her judgment is most obviously 
and significantly impactful. Researchers must therefore go about their re-
search with great care because this is the formative stage of a strategy’s life. 
Mistakes made during research become baked into a strategy for its lifetime, 
and then the systematic implementation of this error can become devastat-
ing. Moreover , the research effort is not a one‐time affair . Rather , the quant 
must continually conduct a vigorous and prolific research program to pro-
duce profits consistently over time.
Models are, by definition, generalized representations of the past behav-
ior of the market. More general models are more robust over time, but they 
are less likely to be very accurate at any point in time. More highly specified 
models have the chance to be more accurate, but they are also more likely 
to break down entirely when market conditions change. This trade‐off, be-
tween generality and specificity, between robustness and accuracy, is the 
key challenge faced by quant researchers. While there is no one‐size‐fits‐all 
answer that I’m aware of to address this challenge, I think Einstein’s words 
provide the best guiding principle: “Everything should be made as simple as 
possible, but not simpler . ”
We have now completed our tour through the black box (see 
Exhibit 9.6), both its component models and the key elements—data and 
research—that drive it. The coming chapters will focus on the evaluation of 
quant traders and their strategies.

Torture numbers, and they’ll confess to anything.

e have defined two broad classes of exposures: those that generate re-
turns in the long run (alpha and beta) and are intentionally accepted 
and those that do not generate long‐term returns (risks) or are incidental to 
the strategy. For the kind of quant traders that are the subject of this book, 
beta exposures are generally avoided (because they can be easily obtained by 
generic, low‐cost index instruments), and therefore we can focus on alpha 
and risk exposures.
As we have already stressed, the kinds of alpha exposures quants seek to 
capture are generally exactly the same as those that are sought by discretion-
ary managers. However, with any strategy there is always the possibility that 
the exposure from which returns are generated is not being rewarded by the 
marketplace at a given point in time. This risk of out‐of‐favor exposure is 
shared by both quants and discretionary traders alike.
This chapter will help an investor understand the types of risks that are 
either unique to quant trading or at least more applicable to quant trading. 
In a sense, we also are providing a framework for investors to design their 
own risk models that can be used to help determine how to use quant trad-
ing as part of a portfolio of strategies. The latter is a topic we address again 
in Chapter 12.

Model rIS k
Model risk is the most basic form of risk any quant system brings to an 
investor. Models are approximations of the real world. If the researcher 
does a poor job of modeling a particular phenomenon—for example, mo-
mentum—the strategy might not be profitable, even in a benign environ-
ment for momentum in general. In other words, model risk is the risk that 
the strategy does not accurately describe, match, or predict the real‐world 
phenomenon it is attempting to exploit. Worse still, model risk need not 
be evident right away. Sometimes small errors in specification or software 
engineering lead to problems that accumulate very slowly over time, then 
suddenly explode on a busy trading day. Additionally, model risk can come 
from several sources. The most common are the inapplicability of modeling, 
model misspecification, and implementation errors. It bears mentioning that 
all types of model risk can occur not only in the alpha model but also from 
errors in any of the other parts of the strategy. Back‐testing software, data 
feed handlers, alpha models, risk models, transaction cost models, portfo-
lio construction models, and execution algorithms can all have model risk  
in them.
Inapplicability of Modeling
Inapplicability of modeling is a fundamental error that comes in two forms. 
The first is the mistaken use of quantitative modeling to a given problem. 
For example, trying to model the quality of a musician is simply the wrong 
idea from the start. One could conceive of some relevant factors that cor -
relate with skill in musicianship, such as the source and duration of training. 
But ultimately, the goodness of a musician is not a question that can be an-
swered with mathematics or computer models. It is an inherently subjective 
question, and to apply computer models to it is an error.
Models that are inapplicable to the problem they’re being used to solve 
are often created due to the use of improper assumptions, coupled with 
wrong judgment regarding the use of a given statistical method. The global 
market turmoil in 2008, which was fueled in part by the securitized mort-
gage business, could be an example of the problem of the inapplicability of 
quantitative modeling to a problem. Though these securitized mortgages 
were not in any way like quant trading strategies, part of their rise to promi-
nence resulted from the quantitative modeling work done by various struc-
tured products desks inside a wide variety of banks around the world. They 
modeled what would happen in various scenarios, and on the back of the 
comfort gained in the output of these models, they issued AAA‐rated bonds 
backed by instruments that, each on its own, were toxic. It appears that a 

## Page 197

Risks Inherent to Quant Strategies  177
fundamental error was made (or ignored to rationalize massive greed) in the 
conceptualization of the problem. In this case, the problem was a failure to 
realize that there absolutely could be a dynamic in the economy that could 
lead to a large number of mortgage defaults simultaneously. The tools used 
to model and value these securities were simply not meant to handle the 
realities of the market to which they were applied.
A second type of inapplicability is subtler and, probably because of this 
subtlety, more common among quant traders. It is the error of misapplica-
tion of an otherwise valid technique to a given problem. One example of 
this type of error, which we have already touched on in the section on risk 
modeling, is the widespread use of value at risk (VaR). Conventional VaR 
uses correlation matrices and historical volatility to determine the amount 
of risk in a given portfolio at a point in time. However, there are many as-
sumptions inherent in the use of VaR that are invalid. For example, the use 
of both correlation matrices and historical volatility (defined as the standard 
deviation of returns) assumes that the underlying distributions that describe 
the various elements in a portfolio are normal. But in fact, market data 
often exhibit fat tails. In other words, there are significantly more observa-
tions of extreme values than one would expect from a normal bell‐curve 
distribution. A specific example of this situation can be seen with data on 
the S&P 500. Based on the daily historical index data (excluding dividends) 
from January 3, 2000, through November 30, 2008, a –4 standard devia-
tion day is one on which the S&P posts a return worse than –5.35 percent. 
A 4 standard deviation event should occur once every 33,333 trading days 
(approximately every 128 years, assuming 260 trading days per year) if the 
S&P’s returns are normally distributed. In fact, the S&P has posted a return 
this poor on average once per 13 months, or 119 times more frequently than 
you’d be led to believe from a normal distribution.
Furthermore, correlation coefficients (a key ingredient in the computa-
tion of VaR measurements) should be used only when a linear relationship 
exists between the two things being correlated. Instead, many instruments 
are not linearly related to each other. Exhibit 10.1 shows an interesting con-
trast between two relationships.
As you can see from the charts, the relationship between XOM and 
JAVA is not linear. Note that the best day for XOM is actually a fairly 
poor day (–5 percent or so) for JAVA. Likewise, the best day for JAVA is 
also a nearly 5 percent loss for XOM. A line that best fits this relationship 
would look more like the Gateway Arch in St. Louis than a straight line. 
By contrast, the relationship between XOM and CVX does appear to be 
reasonably linear. A researcher using correlation to examine the relationship 
between JAVA and XOM would likely be making a model inapplicability 
error because the relationship is nonlinear in the first place.

Model Misspecification
The second kind of model risk is misspecification. Model misspecification 
means that the researcher has built a model that badly describes the real 
world. Practically speaking, a model that doesn’t fit the real world at all is 
unlikely ever to make money and therefore is unlikely to be observable for 
very long before being shut down. As such, the more prevalent misspecifi-
cation errors relate to events that are uncommon. These models work fine 
most of the time, but they fail when an extreme event occurs. A recent ex-
ample of this situation can be seen in the aftermath of August 2007, when 
many quants concluded that they had done a bad job of modeling liquidity 
risk in large‐capitalization U.S. stocks. This is because they looked at only 
the liquidity risk associated with their own holdings in these names. What 
they learned, however, was that if many large traders liquidate similar hold-
ings at the same time, the aggregate size of these positions matters more 
than the size any individual trader holds.
As a direct result of this event, some quants discovered risk model or 
transaction cost model misspecifications and have begun to attempt to cor-
rect these flaws. But again, the rarity and unique nature of such events make 
them extremely difficult to model.
Implementation e rrors
The third and perhaps most common variety of model risk is from errors in 
implementation. All quant trading strategies ultimately are pieces of software 
residing in hardware and network architectures. Implementation errors, or 
errors in programming or architecting systems, can cause serious risk for the 
quant trader, and in some cases also for the market at large. For example, 
imagine that a quant means to have his execution software buy the bid and 
sell the offer price using limit orders. But he programs his execution soft-
ware with the signs reversed so that it buys at the offer and sells at the bid. 
Because of this error, he is now paying the bid/offer spread on every trade—
the exact reverse of his intention. This is an example of a programming er -
ror. In August 2012, Knight Trading lost more than $400 million in a mere 
30 minutes due to a software bug that caused a dormant piece of software to 
come back online, multiplying order sizes and causing Knight to accumulate 
massive positions at highly elevated prices. As they sold those positions off, 
the nine‐figure losses mounted. The losses, both in capital and in confidence, 
have had significant repercussions for Knight. The company nearly went 
bankrupt and was forced to sell over 70 percent of the firm to a consortium 
of investors at a steep discount in order to remain afloat. Not to pick on 
them, but this wasn’t Knight’s first implementation error. In March 2011,  

## Page 200

180  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies 
a “process error” at Knight caused the values of some newly created ex-
change‐traded funds (ETFs) to drop from 80 to 100 percent immediately 
upon their inception (the exchanges canceled those trades).
AXA Rosenberg, too, had a coding error in its risk model that resulted 
in a $217 million loss to clients, which AXA eventually repaid to its inves-
tors, along with a $25 million penalty paid to the SEC to settle the case. In 
this case, the error appears to have been introduced in April 2007, but it 
was not discovered until June 2009, and even after it was discovered, certain 
AXA executives apparently decided to hide the issue from their CEO, not 
to disclose it to investors, nor even to fix the issue. AXA finally disclosed 
the error to clients about three years later, in April 2010. In addition to 
the hefty compensation and penalty AXA paid, their assets under manage-
ment dropped from $62 billion in March 2010 to $18 billion by the end of  
June 2012.
In another case, a successful quant trading firm that will remain anony-
mous made an architectural error. The firm has separate servers for alpha 
models and the execution engine. As we discussed earlier, the portfolio con-
struction model looks to the alpha model for information on what positions 
it should execute on both the long and short sides. At some point during one 
trading day, there was a need to reboot the servers for the system. But when 
the servers were restarted, the execution server came online first, and a few 
minutes later, the alpha model was restored to service. The execution model, 
seeing that it had no signals whatsoever from the alpha model, rapidly and 
automatically began liquidating the portfolio of positions in order to elimi-
nate risk. In the few moments before the alpha server came back online, 80 
percent of the firm’s portfolio was sold off and then had to be reacquired. 
There was no warning that this error existed until it manifested itself in 
this unfortunate manner. The strategy was making perfectly good returns 
but suddenly broke down due to a combination of a specific quirky error 
and the circumstances of the situation. Fortunately, returns were not very 
adversely affected, but this was probably merely lucky. Given the massive 
quantities of code that go into a quant trading strategy, such software and 
architectural errors are unfortunately the most common, but usually least 
painful (the Knight episode in 2012 notwithstanding), types of errors.
r e GIM e Chan G e rIS k
Most quant models are based on historical data. Even those using analysts’ 
forecasts or other sentiment signals turn out to depend heavily on the past 
because sentiment usually is biased in the direction of historical trends. 
Regardless of the type of model, quants use past relationships and behavior 

## Page 201

Risks Inherent to Quant Strategies  181
to develop theories and build models to help predict the future. If markets 
have behaved in a particular way for a while, quants will come to depend on 
that behavior persisting. If there is a regime change, the quant will typically 
suffer because the relationships and behavior he is counting on are altered, 
at least temporarily.
Dependence on the past is certainly one of the more interesting prob-
lems to consider in analyzing quant strategies and determining how to use 
them. In some strategies, dependence on the persistence of historical behav-
ior is explicit, as in the case of trend following. Note that this isn’t neces-
sarily an indictment of these strategies. Indeed, such strategies have made 
money for decades and have exhibited better risk‐adjusted returns than the 
stock market by far. However, if an established trend reverses, the trend fol-
lower will almost certainly lose money. Ironically, mean reversion–focused 
quants may also suffer during a large trend reversal, particularly if they 
are engaged in a relative mean reversion strategy. We might expect that if a 
reversal of trend occurs, this should be good for the mean‐reversion trader, 
since he bets against trends. However, if the reversal is also associated with 
the breakdown of established relationships, this can be quite painful be-
cause of the relative part of the strategy. Exhibit 10.2 illustrates this point.

As you can see, there are four distinct phases in the relationship between 
Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Merrill Lynch (MER). From early 1996 until 
the end of 1997, the stocks were reasonably correlated and showed similar 
trends. From early 1998 until early 2001, on the other hand, the stocks 
behaved very differently from one another, and SCHW in particular began 
to exhibit substantially greater volatility than it had earlier or than it would 
again later. The Internet bubble appears to be the cause of this shift, during 
which investors began to treat SCHW as an online broker, and its shares 
rose and fell with the likes of Ameritrade and E*Trade instead of its more 
traditional peer, MER. Upon the bursting of the Internet bubble, SCHW 
reverted uncannily to MER’s level and tracked it very closely for some time, 
from early 2001 until early 2007. Then, in early 2007, you can see another 
sharp change in the relationship, with MER dramatically underperforming 
SCHW. This, of course, is due to the banking and credit crisis that traces its 
roots to early 2007.
A quant betting on this relationship’s persistence would have suffered 
through two reasonably significant periods in the past 10 years in which the 
relationship did not hold up at all. Whether these stocks have permanently 
decoupled or will revert again at some point in the future is a matter that is 
beyond my ability to forecast. But this is precisely what regime change risk 
is about: A structural shift in the markets causes historical behavior of an 
instrument or the relationships between instruments to change dramatically 
and quickly.
Another example of this kind of structural shift can be seen in the rela-
tionship between value stocks and growth stocks, as measured by the IVE 
and IVW ETFs, which represent S&P 500 Value and S&P 500 Growth, 
respectively. The historical spread between these two ETFs is illustrated in 
Exhibit 10.3.
This figure shows that the S&P Value index outperformed the 
S&P Growth index by some 29 percent from the start of 2004 until 
mid‐May 2007. The spread then trended a bit lower until mid‐July and 
then rapidly fell as quants unwound their portfolios, which clearly had 
been betting on Value to outperform Growth. This unwind, combined with 
the macroeconomic environment,
1 set off a massive rebound in Growth 
relative to Value.
Note that there are two substantial, short‐term reversals of this more 
recent trend, one in January 2008 and one in July through September 2008, 
both of which are circled in the figure. These moves are incredibly sharp, 
actually representing the biggest and fastest moves in this spread in a very 
long time (certainly going back further than this analysis). In 16 trading 
days, from January 9 through 31 of 2008, the Value index recovered more 
than half the underperformance it had experienced in the 160 trading days 

## Page 203

Risks Inherent to Quant Strategies  183
prior to that point. In other words, the reversal was five times faster than 
the trend that preceded it. This was another rather painful experience for 
quants, though not on the order of what was felt in the summer of 2007. 
Over the subsequent 115 trading days, the Value/Growth spread reversed 
over 22 percent, all the way back to breakeven, until mid‐July 2008. At that 
point, another brief but violent six‐trading‐day period saw the spread re-
cover almost 40 percent of the lost ground. In other words, the reversal was 
almost eight times faster than the trend that preceded it. From late August 
through early September, the spread recovered another 36 percent of its lost 
ground, and over the 39‐day period from mid‐July through early September 
the recovery was more than 50 percent in total.
What’s worse, such sharp reversals frequently cause many other types 
of relationships to falter. For example, the sectors that had been underper -
forming (such as financial companies or homebuilders) become the new out-
performers, while those that had been outperforming (such as technology 
companies) tend to become the new laggards. Currencies and bonds also 
tend to reverse, as do commodities (especially over the past five years). An 
illustration of this last point is shown in Exhibit 10.4.

Note that the Oil ETF moves almost like the mirror image of the 
Value/Growth spread, experiencing mirroring reversals in early January 
and mid‐July 2008 (again, indicated by the circled periods on the graph) 
and mirroring trends in between. It is for this reason that regime changes 
are especially painful for quants: They tend to occur across many levels 
simultaneously.

The third in the family of quant‐specific risks comes from exogenous shocks. 
I refer to them as exogenous because they are typically driven by informa-
tion that is not internal to the market. Terrorist attacks, the beginning of a 
new war, and political or regulatory intervention are all examples of exog-
enous shocks. Because quant models utilize market data to generate their 
forecasts, when nonmarket information begins to drive prices, quant strate-
gies typically suffer. This is especially true because such shocks usually also 
result in larger‐than‐normal moves. So, in situations of exogenous shock, we 
have big moves that aren’t explainable by a reasonable model using market 
data but rather by information that is entirely external to the markets (see 
Exhibit 10.5).

The first circled period in the S&P 500 chart in Exhibit 10.5 represents 
the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 
2001. The market was closed for almost a week, and when it reopened, it 
dropped precipitously, only to recover much of that ground rather quickly. 
Ignoring the obviously horrible nature of the attack on civilians, the down-
ward move in markets was actually a continuation of the downward trend in 
stocks that had begun in March 2000 and therefore benefited trend‐follow-
ing strategies. However, many mean reversion strategies and relative‐alpha 
strategies suffered in September 2001 as nonmarket information dramati-
cally and briefly changed the way markets behaved.
A similarly difficult situation was observable with the start of the Iraq 
war in early 2003, which is the second circled period. Suddenly global stock, 
bond, currency, and commodity markets began moving in lockstep with 
each other, all driven by news reports of the U.S. armed forces’ progress 
through Iraq. This, too, resulted in losses for many quants, including trend 
followers, since the move resulted in a reversal of the prior trend across 
several asset classes simultaneously.
The third circled period follows the bailout of Bear Stearns in mid‐
March 2008. This period was negative for many quant strategies because it 
was a sharp trend reversal that was caused by information that could not be

anticipated by machines. Indeed, even the collapse of Bear might well have 
been the result of nonmarket “information,” and as of this writing, the SEC 
is supposed to be investigating potential wrongdoing in the rumors that 
were spread about Bear just in advance of (and which likely contributed to) 
its collapse.
The final circled period represents another rally in the financial sector in 
equities, this one set off by the SEC’s change in shorting rules, which made 
it much harder to short battered financial stocks. Though one can argue 
about whether an SEC intervention or a rumor‐based collapse and govern-
ment‐brokered buyout of a major financial institution are endogenous or 
exogenous to the market, it is unassailably true that the kind of information 
these events presented to market participants was both unquantifiable and 
unusual. As such, exogenous shock risk is a significant byproduct of quant 
investing, one that it is difficult to do anything about (other than with dis-
cretionary overrides).
Conta GI on, or Co MM on Inve S tor, rIS k
The newest member of the quant‐specific risk family is contagion, or com-
mon investor, risk. By this we mean that we experience risk not because of 
the strategy itself but because other investors hold the same strategies. In 
many cases, the other investors hold these strategies as part of a portfolio 
that contains other investments that tend to blow up periodically. The first 
part of this risk factor relates to how crowded the quant strategy in question 
is. A second part relates to what else is held by other investors that could 
force them to exit the quant strategy in a panic, sometimes called the ATM 
effect. In an ATM effect, significant losses in one strategy cause liquida-
tion of a different, totally unrelated strategy. This happens because investors 
who have exposures to both, especially if highly levered, reduce their liquid 
holdings in the face of financial distress and margin calls, since their illiquid 
holdings are usually impossible to sell at such times. In essence, the good, 
liquid strategy is exited to raise cash to cover the losses of the bad, illiquid 
strategy.
This is a particularly challenging type of risk that is certainly not exclu-
sive to quants. However, the clarity with which this risk expressed itself in 
both August 1998 (easily argued not to be a quant event) and August 2007 
(clearly a quant event) demands specific attention. In August 1998, it was 
not quant trading that suffered but other strategies such as merger arbitrage. 
We will discuss both of these events in greater detail later, but for the mo-
ment, it bears mentioning that there is one striking similarity between the 
two: In both cases, a credit crisis leading to illiquidity in credit instruments

sparked a forced sale of more liquid assets that had nothing to do with the 
credit crisis.
In 1998, many relative value equity arbitrage positions, which bet on 
convergence of share prices between stocks that are either dually listed or 
else are merging, suffered dramatically as an indirect result of the Russian 
government’s defaulting on its debt obligations. The famous example used 
by Lowenstein in When Genius Failed was Royal Dutch and Shell, a dual‐
listed company. Royal Dutch had been trading at an 8 to 10 percent premium 
to Shell, and the bet was that the two stocks should eventually converge, 
eliminating the premium. In hopes of this, Long‐Term Capital Management 
(LTCM) and many others had long positions in Shell and short positions in 
Royal Dutch. After all, there was no rational economic reason that a Euro-
pean listing of a given company should outperform a U.S. listing of the same 
company. Yet because LTCM had to vacate this position at a time when there 
was little liquidity, the spread widened from 8 to 10 percent to more than 
20 percent by the time LTCM was trading out of it. The reason that this posi-
tion had to be sold is that LTCM also had massive losses on its positions in 
Russian debt. The Russian bond holdings were part of a relative yield trade 
that paired a long position in high‐yield Russian debt and a short position 
in lower‐yielding U.S. debt (which was a hedge against interest rates moving 
higher globally and which financed the long Russian position). When Russia 
defaulted, no one particularly wanted to buy the billions of dollars of their 
debt that LTCM was stuck with. And so, LTCM was forced to liquidate eq-
uity positions such as Royal Dutch and Shell to raise cash in a panic.

It is inaccurate to call the LTCM crisis a quant blowup. To be sure, 
some of those who worked at LTCM were quite good at mathematics. But 
ultimately, the strategies in which they were engaged, in particular the ones 
that caused the most trouble, were not quant trading strategies. They were 
engaged in a very broad cross‐border and cross‐asset class yield game in 
which they constantly sought to own risky assets and sell safer ones against 
them. It was, in most respects, a highly leveraged, one‐way bet on ongoing 
stability and improvement in emerging markets and the markets in general.
August 2007 was a far different affair and much closer to home for 
most quant funds. Several drivers coincided, leading to disastrous perform-
ance among relative‐value‐oriented quant strategies. The causes were the 
size and popularity of certain quant strategies, the somewhat poor perform-
ance of these strategies for the period leading up to August 2007, the cross‐
ownership of these strategies with far less liquid ones by many players, and 
the widespread use of VaR‐like models to target constant volatility.
The first driver of the quant liquidation crisis of 2007 was the size and 
popularity of quantitative long/short trading strategies. From 2004 to 2007, 
many blue‐chip managers launched quant long/short strategies targeted at 

## Page 208

188  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies 
attracting large pools of investor capital, either large institutions or indi-
vidual retail investors. The firms launching these products were attracted by 
the low turnover and longer‐term investment horizons of long/short strate-
gies, both of which are necessary for the placement of large sums of capital. 
Investors were also attracted by the positive returns in quant long/short 
products from 2004 through the early part of 2007 and by the blue‐chip 
brand‐name managers launching the products. In aggregate, it is likely that 
hundreds of billions in cash was invested in quantitative long/short funds 
and bank proprietary trading desks, and with leverage, quant long/short 
traders likely controlled about $1 trillion in gross positions (the value of 
longs and absolute value of shorts added together). The vast majority of 
these positions were held in larger‐capitalization U.S. securities because the 
large numbers of deeply liquid stocks allowed for sufficient diversification 
and size of assets under management to accommodate both the managers’ 
and investors’ needs. Even though there was actually a great deal of diver -
sity in the underlying models of the various firms launching these products, 
enough of them had sufficient overlap to make individual trades get very 
crowded.
The second driver of the debacle was that many of these operators had 
already begun to suffer subpar returns for a period leading up to the summer 
of 2007. Many big‐name funds with a U.S. focus were flat or negative year 
to date before August. This is partly because “value” had underperformed 
“growth” since at least the end of May 2007, after several years of outper -
forming growth, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Many multistrategy and 
prop‐trading desks also tend to chase recent performance, adding capital to 
whatever has been doing well and reducing whatever has been doing poorly. 
This tendency, coupled with the weak results of quant long/short trading 
strategies for the few months leading up to summer 2007, is likely to have 
contributed to especially itchy trigger fingers for risk managers who already 
felt the need to reduce risk in their broader portfolios.
A third cause, and in my view a critically important one, was the wide-
spread practice, especially among banks’ proprietary trading desks and mul-
tistrategy hedge funds, of either explicitly or implicitly cross‐collateralizing 
many strategies against each other. The huge profits enjoyed by hedge funds 
and prop‐trading desks before this summer attest to their exposure to credit 
spreads that kept narrowing in early 2008. These credit‐based strategies 
have historically proven to be far less liquid in a crisis than they appear 
during “normal market conditions,” and in July 2007 some credit managers 
experienced spectacular and sudden losses. This, in turn, drove them to seek 
to raise cash by selling whatever strategies were still liquid. This ATM effect 
is the main similarity between the 2007 meltdown and the 1998 situation 
described earlier.

The fourth factor leading up to the liquidation was risk targeting (which 
we discussed in Chapter 7), whereby risk managers target a specific level of 
volatility for their funds or strategies. They hope to achieve this “constant 
risk” by adjusting leverage inversely with the amount of risk their portfolios 
are taking. The most common tool for measuring the amount of risk in a 
portfolio is VaR. As already discussed, VaR measures the risk of individual 
instruments (using the variability of their returns over time) and combines 
this with how similarly they are trading to each other (a correlation matrix). 
With models such as these, risk is computed to be higher when market vola-
tility is higher and/or when correlations among individual instruments are 
higher. However, note that these two phenomena can be causally linked in 
that markets tend to become more volatile precisely because they are being 
driven by a risk factor that also leads to higher‐than‐normal correlation 
among individual instruments. In other words, both inputs to a VaR risk 
model can rise simultaneously, and these increases can be driven by the same 
underlying causes.
The decline in market volatility that characterized the period from 2003 
through 2006 led to a dramatic increase in the amount of leverage employed 
in a wide variety of strategies heading into 2007 through two channels. 
The first was by virtue of the use of risk targeting models for leverage, as 
described above. When volatility declined, risk targeting models called for 
increased leverage to keep volatility constant. To deliver the same volatil-
ity in early 2007 as was being delivered in, say, 2002 or 2003 would have 
necessitated increasing leverage by at least one‐and‐a‐half to two times. In 
other words, what used to be a four‐times gross leverage strategy had be-
come a six‐ or eight‐times leveraged strategy.
Secondly, when volatility declines, opportunity also declines, and returns 
tend to go down. Strategies that had been reliable producers of double‐digit 
returns in the late 1990s and early 2000s had begun to deliver low single‐
digit results. Investors and managers both wanted better nominal returns, 
and thus leverage went up, even with many shops that did not utilize risk 
targeting approaches. However, in summer 2007, particularly in late July, 
volatility began to spike dramatically as the credit crisis began in earnest. 
This led to a requirement for many players to reduce leverage simultane-
ously because their VaR models reacted very negatively to the simultaneous 
jumps in correlations and volatility.
To review, there were four main drivers of the crisis quants faced in 
August 2007: (1) large sums of money invested in value‐based quant strate-
gies with at least some similarity to each other—in other words, the “crowded 
trade” effect; (2) poor year‐to‐date performance in quant long/short trading 
in the United States; (3) cross‐ownership of illiquid credit‐based strategies 
that were experiencing large losses alongside more liquid quant strategies, 

## Page 210

190  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies 
causing the latter to be used as an ATM in a time of crisis; and (4) the decline 
of volatility, which led to increased leverage both because of volatility tar -
geting‐based leverage adjustments and the desire to produce higher nominal 
returns.
It appears that the crisis started when several large multistrategy hedge 
funds and/or proprietary trading desks began to deleverage their portfolios 
in response to poor performance in credit‐oriented strategies. In addition, 
market volatility was rising, leading to higher VaR levels and therefore low-
er leverage targets. The deleveraging began with quant long/short trading 
in the United States, the most liquid strategy at hand, which also happened 
to have been underperforming. Managers sold off their longs and covered 
their shorts, causing substantial market impact. The stocks that had been 
long positions experienced substantial, fundamentally inexplicable price de-
clines while the stocks that had been short positions experienced similarly 
violent price increases. This meant that anyone holding any of those stocks 
in the same direction as they had been held by the liquidators saw large, 
adverse performance as a result. In many cases, stocks were moving at in-
credible speed on massively increased volume as quants had to unwind their 
holdings.
For example, one crowded short trade was in Pulte Homes (NYSE: 
PHM). Exhibit 10.6 illustrates the issue.
This table contains several fascinating pieces of data. Note that PHM 
was declining through the early part of the summer on an average vol-
ume of 3.5 million shares per day. Then, on July 24, the volume spiked to 
7.2 million shares per day, and the stock exhibited an accelerating price de-
cline. Over the next four trading days, however, volumes increased another 
50 percent, and there was a huge reversal in the stock, which recovered 
about half its 44‐day decline in four days (i.e., the stock was moving about 
20 times faster than it had been previously). This also happens to be an 
interesting illustration of the quadratic nature of market impact. The first 
100 percent increase in volume was absorbed by the marketplace without 
a change in the stock’s direction. But the next 50 percent increase seemed 
to be on the wrong side of a tipping point in the market’s supply of sellers,

and indeed, a trader covering a short position on August 9 was paying as 
much as 15 percent in market impact, many hundreds of times the average 
cost to liquidate. As soon as the liquidation pressure subsided, which by 
all accounts was during the afternoon of August 9, the stock resumed its 
downward march, falling almost 23 percent on volumes much closer to the 
average prior to the quant liquidation.
Other types of quant traders, such as statistical arbitrageurs, seemed 
to provide the necessary liquidity to quant long/short players in late July. 
Statistical arbitrageurs usually feast on environments like this, and no doubt 
many were happy to provide liquidity as they bet that prices would eventu-
ally converge. Many long positions with relatively attractive valuation char-
acteristics were being sold at extremely depressed levels while expensive, 
poorer‐quality short positions were reaching ever‐higher prices as a result 
of the quant long/short liquidations. These stocks had diverged from their 
peers so significantly that they must have appeared to be excellent trading 
opportunities to the average stat arb trader, who bets that such stocks will 
converge again to a “fair” relative value. But at some point, the stat arb 
traders were also experiencing significant losses by taking on the inventory 
of other quant funds, inventory that kept flooding the market relentlessly. In 
front of this tidal wave, stat arb traders could not continue providing liquid-
ity. As they began to experience losses from having acquired these positions, 
they, too, became anxious to go to cash, adding fuel to the fire.
This was likely the tipping point, and suddenly both stat arb traders and 
quant long/short traders began to experience significant losses that weren’t 
explained at all by fundamentals but purely by a lack of sufficient liquidity. 
Thus, by August 7 the situation was starting to get very troubling. A broader 
set of strategies, such as statistical arbitrage, was losing money at breakneck 
speed and beginning to liquidate alongside the quant long/short traders. 
Finally, the dam broke on August 8, with huge losses across many types of 
strategies and with these strategies responding by suddenly liquidating in 
an effort to preserve capital. Losses began to spread from U.S. strategies to 
international strategies, especially those implemented in Japan (which was 
at that time the most popular non‐U.S. market for quant long/short and 
statistical arbitrage trading).
A wide range of fundamental signals began to lose money as the over -
lap between the aggregate of all liquidating managers began to overwhelm 
virtually any level of differentiation between managers. For the first time 
during this crisis, even growth‐based and momentum‐oriented factors be-
gan to lose money rapidly. Note that these strategies usually hold opposite 
positions from the value‐oriented and mean‐reversion‐oriented strategies. 
Thursday, August 9, was pure bedlam in Quant Land. An enormous cross‐
section of strategies, many of which were extremely far removed from the 

## Page 212

192  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies 
original losers, began to bleed money. Intraday P&L charts started negative 
in the morning and literally every minute of the day ticked lower and lower 
as a huge variety and number of quant equity funds liquidated positions. 
Whereas a few signals had still been working on August 8, in quant eq-
uity trading it was hard to find anything except cash that made money on 
August 9. It appears that any stock that was attractive for any reason was 
being sold down, whereas any stock that was unattractive for any reason 
was running up. In short, most quant equity traders had the worst day in 
their history, and a great many reduced leverage to extremely low levels, 
with many shops going completely to cash.
A bit more should be mentioned about why so many managers reacted in 
the same way, namely by deleveraging and liquidating positions. Early August 
was a period of exceedingly perverse behavior. Not only were tried‐and‐true 
factors not working, they were actually working negatively. And because the 
primary discretion employed by a great many quant managers is the deci -
sion to unwind positions in the event that the models are behaving badly, 
quant managers did exactly that, leading other managers with any overlap 
experiencing losses and doing exactly the same thing in response. The losses 
incurred, it is important to note, were solely the result of market impact.
One of the clearest proofs of this point is that one large, well‐known 
quant firm was suffering like everyone else in early August. On August 9, 
in a panic, the firm tried to convene its investment committee to determine 
what to do. But several members of the committee were on their summer 
holidays, so a meeting was scheduled for Monday, August 13, and in the 
meantime the lieutenants managing the portfolio day to day kept the fund 
fully invested. As shown earlier in Exhibit 10.6, prices returned to their 
previous trends fairly quickly when the liquidations stopped. (PHM, for 
example, was down about 12.3 percent by the close of business on Monday, 
August 13, merely two trading days later.) As such, by the time the invest-
ment committee met, its fund had recovered a huge proportion of its losses, 
and the committee elected to hold the course.
Perhaps the greatest irony of the broader situation in August 2007 was 
that smaller, more boutique quant traders, engaged in less commonplace 
strategies that had minimal overlap with the more conventional and larger‐
scale institutional quants, ended up experiencing losses and liquidating their 
portfolios only very late in the game. As alluded to earlier, managers whose 
losses began to accumulate only in the middle of the second week of August 
ended up needing liquidity at the tail end of an already massive deleverag-
ing. This forced them to pay incredible transaction costs (all from market 
impact) to reduce their leverage. Reports of losses at extremely prestigious 
funds abounded. The range of losses was wide, from –5 to –45 percent, and 
few equity traders emerged unscathed from this event.

What separated August 2007 from prior market crises, even from the 
great crash of 1987, was that there was no general market panic during this 
period. U.S. stocks were approximately flat for the first 10 days of August, 
whereas stocks internationally were down in the small single digits. What 
we witnessed in this period was nothing short of a liquidity crisis in the most 
liquid stocks in the world, driven by market‐neutral investors whose hun-
dreds of billions of dollars of position selling led not to a market collapse but 
to almost no change at all in equity index values. It was a situation where 
losses were very heavily attributable to the cost of liquidation and market 
impact, rather than simply “being wrong” about the trade to begin with. 
This is a fine, mostly academic distinction, but in dissecting the incident, it 
bears mentioning. This situation illustrated for the first time that contagion/
common investor risk can appear in liquid quant strategies almost as much 
as in illiquid or discretionary strategies. For the first time, crowding became 
a risk of quant trading strategies.

Any discussion of quant‐specific risks also merits a discussion of quant‐
specific tools used to target those risks. Chapter 7 described risk models at 
some length as models that seek to eliminate or control the size of exposures 
in a portfolio. But quants also utilize various pieces of software to monitor 
these exposures, their systems, and the kinds of quant‐specific risks we have 
discussed in this chapter. There are several types of monitoring tools, most 
notably exposure monitoring, profit and loss monitoring, execution moni-
toring, and systems performance monitoring.
Exposure monitoring tools are straightforward enough. They start with 
the current positions held and then group and/or analyze these positions for 
whatever exposures the manager is concerned about. For example, in a fu -
tures portfolio, if the manager wants to see how much of his portfolio he has 
invested in the various asset classes (equities, bonds, currencies, and commod-
ities), this is something he can do with exposure monitoring software. Simi-
larly, one can group instruments by any other set of characteristics that are of 
interest, such as their valuation, the level of momentum they have exhibited, 
their volatility, and so on. Many equity traders (using either proprietary tools 
or off‐the‐shelf software such as BARRA or Northfield) monitor their gross 
and net exposure to various sectors and industries, to various buckets of mar-
ket capitalizations, and to various style factors such as value and growth. 
VaR‐based tools also measure exposure in terms of the overall, gross level 
of risk being taken in a portfolio, at least according to that measure of risk. 
The tools are straightforward, but the art is in how to use them. Experienced

managers can discern from the exposures in their portfolios whether the mod-
el is behaving as it should be. If exposures are out of line based on either limits 
or expectations, this can be an early warning that there is a problem with the 
model or else problematic market conditions.
Profit and loss monitors are similarly straightforward. They also start 
with the current portfolio, but they then look at the prices at which the port-
folio’s positions closed the previous day and compare those to the current 
market prices for the same instruments. Many managers look at charts of 
the intraday performance of their strategies to determine quickly and visu-
ally how the day is going. These tools are also important in watching out for 
several types of model risk. If the strategy appears to be performing in an 
unexpected manner, either making money when it should be losing or vice 
versa, the manager can check into the reasons for this anomalous behavior. 
Or alternatively, the manager can see patterns in his performance that can 
alert him to problems. We alluded to this idea in discussing the perform-
ance of various quant strategies during August 2007, when the intraday 
performance charts were showing deterioration in the performance with 
nearly every passing tick. We know of at least one manager who noticed this 
intraday pattern and, as a result, quickly conducted research that enabled 
him to reduce his risk much earlier than most, thereby saving him much of 
the loss experienced by other traders who only acted later.
Other types of profit and loss monitors look at how money is being 
made or lost rather than whether money is being made or lost. For exam-
ple, quants can analyze the realized and unrealized gains and losses of their 
strategies. Many strategies are constructed to cut losing positions quickly 
and ride winning positions longer. But if a quant sees that her strategy is 
holding losers for longer than usual or selling winners more quickly than 
usual, this can be an indicator that something is wrong and needs to be 
corrected. This kind of tool also frequently tracks a hit rate, which is the 
percentage of the time that the strategy makes money on a given position. 
Again, the designer of a strategy usually understands what the hit rate of a 
trading strategy should look like, and substantial deviations from the norm 
in this metric can be important indicators of problems.
Execution monitoring tools are usually designed to show the quant 
trader the progress of his executions. They typically show what orders are 
currently being worked and which ones recently were completed, along with 
the sizes of the transactions and prices. Fill rates for limit orders are also 
tracked to help monitor the execution algorithms’ performance, particularly 
for more passive execution strategies. Some managers specifically measure 
and monitor slippage and market impact in their order execution monitor -
ing software, which allows them to see whether they are getting the kinds of 
results from their execution strategies that they would expect.

Finally, systems performance monitors are used largely to check for 
software and infrastructure errors. Quant traders can monitor any aspect 
of their technology, from the performance of CPUs or the speed of various 
stages of their automated processes to latency in the communication of mes-
sages to and from the exchanges. This kind of monitoring is perhaps the 
most important for sniffing out systems errors and some types of model risk.
Su MM ary
Quant trading offers many potential benefits to investors and practitioners. 
The discipline, computing power, and scientific rigor brought to bear on the 
challenge of making money in a highly competitive marketplace certainly 
pay dividends overall. However, quants have their own sets of problems to 
deal with. Some of these problems are unique to quants (e.g., model risk), 
but most are simply more significant for a quant strategy than for a discre-
tionary one (e.g., common investor or contagion risk, exogenous shock risk, 
and regime change risk). Quants utilize various types of tools to monitor 
their systems and risk, which can mitigate the downside associated with the 
risks of quant trading.
Having discussed the challenges facing a quant trader and how the 
quant faces these challenges, we turn our attention to various criticisms of 
quant trading that are widely espoused in the marketplace.

 1.  The macroeconomic environment around this time, and for some time there-
after, favored companies that are in “growth” industries. During this period, 
that meant those positively linked to commodity prices, such as oil companies 
or gold‐mining companies, and those in businesses that are less dependent on 
economic cycles, such as telecommunications firms.

ecently, and periodically in the past, people have loved to hate quants. 
In 1987, a quant strategy known as portfolio insurance was blamed for 
the crash that occurred that October . In 1998, people blamed quant models 
for the LTCM crisis and the near‐collapse of financial markets. In the sum-
mer of 2007, though, it might well be that the tide of public opinion turned 
from leery and suspicious to overtly negative. There could be many and 
various reasons for this sentiment. Some of the predilection is likely owed 
to widespread hatred of math classes in grade school, some of it to fear of 
the unknown, and some to occasional and sensational blowups by one or 
several black boxes. But, as is the case with many things that are not widely 
understood, the arguments against quant trading range from entirely valid 
to utterly ridiculous. It is worth noting that almost every type of trading in 
capital markets faces valid criticisms. In other words, quant trading, like any 
other type of trading, has its pluses and minuses.
This chapter addresses many of the most common criticisms of quant 
trading and some of my own. Where relevant, I also present counterpoints 
in defense of quants.

The markets are largely driven by humans’ responses to the information 
they receive. Not all this information is understandable systematically. 
Furthermore, the process by which different people interpret the same

piece of information is not systematic. If the CEO of a company is fired, is 
that good news or bad news? One trader might argue that it shows insta -
bility at the highest levels of office and is therefore terrible news. Another 
might say that the CEO deserved to have been fired, it was a situation well 
handled by the board of directors, and the company is far better off now. 
Neither can be proven right ex ante. So, critics of quant trading claim, how 
can anyone believe that you can really model the markets? Their critique is 
that markets are ultimately driven by humans, and human behavior can’t 
be modeled.
This criticism of quant trading is rather backward, reminiscent of the 
persecution of scientists such as Galileo and Copernicus for proposing ideas 
that challenged human authority. Humans have successfully automated and 
systematized many processes that used to be done by hand, from manufac-
turing automobiles and flying planes to making markets in stocks. Yes, of 
course there is still room for humans to make or do various products or 
services by hand, but when commerce is the main objective, we typically 
see that the efficiency and consistency of automated processes outweigh the 
benefit and cachet of doing things manually.
The idea that human behavior cannot be modeled is a bit less easily 
dismissed, but it is also unlikely to be true. Consider that quantitative tech-
niques are extraordinarily successful for determining what books you might 
like at Amazon.com, in mining data in customer relationship management 
software, and in human resources departments seeking to determine which 
universities produce the best employees. Obviously, as we have already dis-
cussed, there is always the risk of trying to get computers to answer ques-
tions that shouldn’t have been asked of them and of building models that 
are not good representations of the real world. But in many cases, quant 
trading included, it is entirely feasible to demonstrate that something hu-
mans do with mixed results can be done just as well by computers: to profit 
from trading the markets.
Indeed, when done well, computerized trading strategies have 
tended to be exceptional performers over very long periods, as dem -
onstrated by the examples we’ve used so far (Ed Seykota, Renaissance, 
Princeton‐Newport Partners, D. E. Shaw, and Two Sigma). In the best 
cases, models are merely simulations of the real world, not replications. 
So we cannot expect a quant’s models to be perfect, just as we cannot 
expect Amazon.com to recommend exactly the right book every time. 
However, over time, a well‐designed quant strategy can predict enough 
of the behavior of the markets to generate substantial profit for practi -
tioners, as evidenced by the results of some of the quant firms we high -
lighted in Chapter 2.

This criticism contains components of truth and of falsehood. Many man -
agers, quants included, are subject to a fundamental type of model risk we 
discussed in the last chapter , namely asking the wrong questions and using 
the wrong techniques. T echniques such as V aR, for example, make numer-
ous wrong assumptions about the market in an effort to distill the concept of 
risk down to a single number , which is a goal that itself seems mostly point-
less. Furthermore, as illustrated by the August 2007 quant liquidation crisis, 
quants have underestimated the downside risk of being involved in large‐
scale, crowded trading strategies. This, too, stems from a fundamental flaw of 
quantitative trading. Computers can be given a problem that is badly framed 
or makes too many assumptions, and they can come up with an answer that 
is both highly precise and entirely wrong. For example, I can drum up a model 
of my wealth that assumes that this book will sell 50 million copies, that I will 
receive 50 percent of the proceeds, and that I can then invest the proceeds into 
a vehicle that will earn 100 percent per year , compounded, forever . With this 
model I can get precise answers to the question of my earnings as far into the 
future as I want. However , all of my assumptions are highly suspect, at best.
The computer’s job is not to judge my assumptions, so this kind of er -
ror is ultimately attributable to my poor judgment. Similarly, some quants 
can be blamed for using quantitative models that are either inappropriate or 
badly designed to measure risk. That said, they are scarcely alone in mak-
ing these errors. Indeed, VaR itself was developed to appease risk managers 
and banking regulators who were interested in having a single number to 
summarize downside risk, rather than do the difficult and nuanced work of 
understanding risk from many perspectives. So, though we accept the criti-
cism that quants can underestimate risk or measure it wrongly, it is worth 
understanding that they are not alone. Decision makers in almost every field 
commonly manage to underestimate worst‐case scenarios, and when they 
do not, it is usually to overestimate risk in the aftermath of a disastrous 
event. This is largely because extreme risks are so rare that it is very difficult 
to ascertain their probability or the damage they can cause. So, we find that 
the statement that quants underestimate risk is likely to be true, but we also 
find this to be due more to human nature and the circumstances of rare 
events than to something specific in quant trading.
The idea that this underestimation of risk on the part of quants is some-
how responsible for an increase in market volatility is, however , plainly ri-
diculous. First, we have already shown in Chapter 2 that quants tend to 
reduce market volatility and inefficiency during normal times. Regardless 

## Page 220

of what happens in abnormal, chaotic times, this fact should not be sim-
ply discounted. Second, extreme events have been happening since people 
could trade with each other . Preliminarily, we can look at extreme events 
in stocks and other asset classes. There were five distinct drawdowns in 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average that were worse than 40 percent before 
quant trading existed (indeed, before there were computers in general use). 
The worst of these occurred during the Great Depression, which brought 
with it a drawdown of almost 90 percent in the Dow and which took until 
1954 to recover . The last drawdown in stocks before quant trading became 
a significant force began in January 1973, reached a nadir of –45 percent 
in December 1974, and was not fully recovered until November 1982. The 
next severe drawdown in stocks since then was the bear market of March 
2000 through October 2002, which was set off by the bursting of the dot‐
com bubble. It is ridiculous to claim that a single one of these events of 
extreme volatility or prolonged pain was the responsibility of quant traders. 
The same analysis holds for other asset classes. The worst event in recent 
history in bonds was Russia’s default in 1998. This impacted some “quant” 
firms (though, as mentioned in Chapter 10, I reject wholesale the idea that 
LTCM was actually a quant trading firm), but was certainly not caused 
by quants. The currency problems in Mexico and Asia in 1995 and 1997, 
respectively, were also not the result of quants’ activities. In fact, at the 
time a rather famous discretionary macro trader , George Soros, was widely 
(though not necessarily correctly) blamed by Asian governments for trigger-
ing the latter event.
We can also look at the broader question of how quants are related 
to market crises from the opposite perspective. How does a crisis in quant 
trading relate to changes in or levels of market volatility? Since we so far 
have only one example to work from, we will focus on the events of August 
2007. The Dow Jones Industrial Average’s historical volatility did move up 
during the two‐week period in which quants were experiencing pain that 
summer . However , the Dow’s realized volatility moved from a significantly 
below‐average level to a level that is equal to its average volatility since 1900. 
From the close of trading on August 3 through August 9, 2007, certainly the 
worst part of the quant liquidation crisis, the Dow was actually up an esti-
mated 1.1 percent—scarcely cause for alarm. Implied volatility, as measured 
by the VIX index, moved up during this period, from 25.16 to 26.48, but 
this is by no means a significant change in its level over a four‐day period. 
It would be an impressive stretch of the imagination to attribute any change 
in market volatility to quant traders. Indeed, of infinitely greater impor -
tance to downside risk in markets and upside swings in volatility levels are 
policymakers’ decisions, exogenous shocks (e.g., wars or terrorist attacks),

basic economic cycles, and run‐of‐the‐mill manias and panics. With that, I 
believe that the extraordinary events of 2008 bear discussion.
The Market Turmoil of 2008
While I was writing the first edition of this book in the summer of 2008, 
the financial world was suffering through its most challenging environment 
since the Great Depression. Stocks endured their second distinct 40‐plus 
percent decline in a single decade, and dozens of banks around the world 
had either gone bankrupt or been nationalized, including two of the five 
largest U.S. investment banks. Real estate prices crashed in many parts of 
the world. Several money‐market funds lost all or most of their value. Sev-
eral of the largest insurance and mortgage companies in the United States 
were nationalized or required rescuing. The nation of Iceland was effectively 
bankrupted and actually went to Russia to seek a loan. Record‐setting bail-
out packages and unprecedented, multinational government‐backing meas-
ures were enacted in an attempt to stabilize the financial system, which U.S. 
Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson reportedly told the U.S. Congress 
was “days from a complete meltdown. ” Most forms of financial activity, in 
particular credit, were frozen almost entirely. I raise this example of market 
turmoil for two reasons: (1) to evaluate whether quants can be blamed for 
it and (2) to discuss how quants have fared. This is not intended to be a 
thorough examination of the crisis itself.
It turns out that we can understand a fair amount about what brought us 
to that precipice: It was caused by irresponsible banks that lent money without 
proper diligence to unqualified consumers who acted with total disregard to 
their own financial realities; enabled by ratings agencies that had lost all sense 
of independence and objectivity; and regulators who ignored or even exacer-
bated the problem. Dodgy accounting practices, incredible amounts of leverage, 
extreme greed and recklessness among people who should know better , skewed 
compensation practices, and lofty egos also played significant roles.
Short sellers and hedge funds were widely blamed for causing the crisis, 
and indeed, it does appear possible that irresponsible rumor mongering on 
the Internet might have been partially to blame. (Though I have not seen 
anyone propose banning the Internet or the kinds of sites that give rumors 
such wide audiences.) There is no acceptable excuse for those who spread 
such rumors. But let us be clear and explicit: This was an equally irrespon-
sible attempt to divert attention from the real causes and culprits, many of 
whom were loudly lobbying for banning short sales and hedge funds.
The facts are unchanged, despite the attempted smokescreen: Many 
banks did in fact have toxic balance sheets, uncounted and untold billions 

## Page 222

in losses, and no way to solve the problem. The bailout package passed by 
Congress in 2008 approved $700 billion of rescue money, and while that, 
coupled with the American Recovery Act and the most benign monetary 
policy in American history, was enough to stem the pace of the collapse, it 
is clear that the U.S. economy has not come close to a full recovery from 
this event four years removed from its occurrence. Furthermore, Europe’s 
woes have only recently come into focus, but they are at least equally deep 
as those in the United States. Even China appears vulnerable lately. In other 
words, this is one hell of a very real mess, not just a rumor‐driven illusion. 
Nonetheless, to appease those railing against hedge funds and short sellers, 
the U.S. SEC banned all short sales of 799 financial stocks from September 
19 to October 8, 2008. During this time, the Financial Select Sector SPDR 
(AMEX: XLF), an exchange‐traded fund (ETF) tracking the financial sector , 
fell another 23 percent (slightly worse, if we exclude a roughly 1 percent 
dividend issued during this period). By contrast, one week after the ban was 
lifted and financial companies were again allowed to be sold short, XLF 
gained slightly versus its closing price on October 8.
Quants, according to some, are at least partly to blame for the housing 
bubble which, when it burst, unleashed all this havoc. How? Nonsensical 
arguments have been made
1 connecting supposedly quant traders like Ken 
Griffin and Boaz Weinstein to the crisis. These arguments have two major 
flaws. First, most of those funds that were involved in credit trading are not 
traded systematically at all. While both Griffin and Weinstein are good at 
math, their investment strategies are fully discretionary. Secondly, even if we 
were to call them quants, neither fund’s activities in any way precipitated 
anything associated with the real economic crisis that unfolded in 2008.
It is, in fact, pretty close to inconceivable how anyone could think other-
wise. The kinds of credit trading and other arbitrage trading that dominate 
both Griffin’s Citadel and Weinstein’s Saba hedge funds are busy looking 
for trades that take advantage (for example) of mispricings between various 
tranches of a company’s capital structure (equity and various types of debt 
issuances). The art in these kinds of trades is mostly related to legal and 
accounting skills, and there is nothing systematic about them whatsoever . 
Citadel has also made a name buying massively distressed assets, as they did 
in both the cases of Amaranth and Sowood. Connecting such activities with 
quant trading is an obvious mistake. But inferring that they were involved 
in the creation of a crisis is like saying the world is round because California 
grows good avocados.
Less ridiculous arguments were made about the structured products 
boom on Wall Street that was far more instrumental in the crisis of 2008. It 
is clear that many parties were to blame for the credit crisis. The stories of 
modest income‐earners buying fancy houses with no down payments and

no proof of financial wherewithal are well known. Regulators and ratings 
agencies enabled (and quite possibly ensured) irresponsible lending and bor-
rowing that would power the housing bubble. Here, too, other sources are 
better than this book on this topic.2 So where do quants come in?
Structured products did play a role in the crisis, making it attractive 
to lenders to provide loans to utterly unqualified borrowers at massively 
inflated home values and with little collateral to protect them. This was 
accomplished by an abuse of the concept of diversification. The thinking 
was that making one bad loan was a bad idea. But making a huge number 
of equally bad loans was probably a completely fine idea because, it was 
infamously assumed, not all those loans would go bad all at once. In other 
words, those who transact in these securities composed of a bunch of loans 
were making a convenient, but highly questionable, assumption that there 
would be no systemic risk that would cause the loans all to go bad at once. 
How the possibility of a drop in home values or a serious recession was 
ignored, I’m not sure.
There is a tremendous amount of fairly sophisticated mathematics in the 
determination of the pricing of these securities and analyses of their credit 
risk.
3 The techniques have names like copulas, Lévy models, and saddlepoint 
approximations. But as I indicated from the very beginning, quant trading 
has little to do with the financial engineering that drives the creation of 
structured products, and nothing to do with their promulgation throughout 
the investment community. Yes, both quant trading and financial engineer-
ing utilize mathematics in the field of finance. However , that is the extent of 
the similarity, and it is a microscopic overlap. Quant traders do not originate 
securities, show them to ratings agencies, market them to pension funds, and 
so on. Financial engineers are not responsible for making forecasts of the 
future movements of various financial instruments, nor for executing trades. 
Quant traders don’t usually have to think about how to value anything: 
The prices of the instruments they trade are generally knowable with a high 
degree of certainty, as they are generally extremely liquid and most often 
exchange traded.
So quants weren’t a cause of the credit crisis, but how did they fare 
through it? In short, better than most. In 2008, many quantitative equity 
firms struggled, posting losses in the –10 percent range for the year . But 
a great many quants, using statistical arbitrage, short‐term trading, and 
even some longer‐term trading strategies, actually made substantial gains. 
And in other fields of quant trading, 2008 was a banner year . Quantitative 
commodity trading advisors (CTAs) and short‐term traders in various as -
set classes, in particular , performed rather well through the crisis. But even  
if –10 percent was the norm, why should this be considered a particularly 
bad outcome, especially compared to the alternatives? Stocks have cut

investors’ money in half twice in the past decade. Many large, storied 
money market funds have gone bust. To my way of thinking, these are 
examples of extremely risky investments, not quant hedge funds. And as 
just mentioned, it is categorically untrue that quants in general struggled 
in 2008.
This is also not the first time that quants have demonstrated good per -
formance in turbulent times. In the last two severe market dislocations, in 
the summer of 1998 and in the bear market of 2000 to 2002, quants again 
proved to be outperformers. Both periods, in fact, were quite good for a 
great many quants, with some having the best results in their histories dur -
ing these times. Even in the crash of October 1987, most quantitative trend‐
following CTAs posted tremendously strong returns. This isn’t to say that 
they are immune from losses or unaffected by market turmoil. The point is 
that there seems to be an immense double standard applied to quants com-
pared with more traditional markets and even other hedge funds in terms of 
what is considered risky.

This is perhaps the most valid criticism of quant trading. Quants must 
rely on historical data to make predictions about the future. As a result 
of this dependency, it is likely that quants will suffer any time there is a 
significant and sudden change in the way markets behave. It bears repeat -
ing and emphasizing that, in order for the event to be of importance to a 
quant, the regime change must be both large and without much warning. 
Perhaps the most challenging time for quant trading in its known his -
tory has been the period from late July 2007 through August 2008. Over 
this roughly 13‐month window, quants (particularly those implementing 
equity market neutral strategies) faced a liquidity crisis and at least three 
separate episodes of substantial pain. You can see this illustrated in part 
in Exhibit 11.1.
As you can see from this figure, Value outperformed Growth from 
mid‐2004 through early 2007. There was a reversal of this trend beginning 
in mid‐May 2007, which accelerated aggressively in late July 2007 and was 
a likely cause of the poor performance among quants that contributed to 
their liquidation. The trend favoring growth over value from May 2007 
to January 2008 is easily seen to be sharper than that which favored value 
before May 2007. Many quant strategies had adapted to this new regime 
by the middle of the fall of 2007, leading to strong performance in the later 
part of that year . But two other periods catch the eye: one in January 2008 

## Page 225

Criticisms of Quant Trading  205
and the other in July 2008, both of which are circled in the chart. These two 
events were rather violent reversals of the strong trend favoring growth that 
began in May 2007. These reversals were among the sharpest in the history 
of this spread, and both were substantial periods of downside risk for many 
quant traders, particularly those in equities. This is because the prevailing 
pattern of behavior , on which the quant bases forecasts of future behavior , 
becomes inverted at such times.
It is worth mentioning that, although the significant majority of quant 
strategies are negatively impacted by regime changes, a small minority are 
able to successfully navigate these periods. Some shorter‐term strategies spe-
cifically seek to profit from short reversals of longer‐term trends and the re-
sumption of such longer‐term trends. These counter‐trend traders have been 
able to profit in many of the most difficult periods for quants (but certainly 
not all of them). Others sit on the sidelines during normal times, waiting for 
large dislocations to signal the beginning of a potentially profitable trading 
period. This kind of trading is known as breakout trading. Both of these 
styles can be found in any asset class or instrument class but are most gener-
ally done with futures instruments in the most liquid markets.

This argument, too, has been widely held to be true, particularly in the wake 
of the disastrous performance of many quants in August 2007. However , it 
is a patently false claim, and this I can state with both vehemence and cer -
tainty. We will focus again on both theoretical and empirical evidence of this 
truth, starting with the former .
This book has outlined many of the kinds of decisions each quant must 
make in the process of building a quant strategy. These decisions include the 
kinds of instruments and asset classes to trade, the sources of data one will 
use and how these should be cleaned, ways to research and develop trading 
strategies, the kinds of phenomena being traded, how these phenomena are 
specified, ways in which various forecasts are combined, how far into the 
future forecasts are being made, how bets are structured, ways in which risk 
is defined and managed, how transaction costs are modeled, how portfo-
lios are constructed, and how trades are executed. The number of degrees 
of freedom for a quant in building a trading strategy is, in other words, 
very large. Though the kinds of phenomena are not very numerous, all the 
other considerations are ways the quant can differentiate his approach from 
those of others who are ostensibly looking for the same types of anomalies. 
Depending on the time horizon of the strategy and number of positions it 
takes, the number of trades per year can easily get into the millions. I know 
many traders who execute 10,000 to 100,000 trades each trading day. As 
you can imagine, small differences in how one arrives at a single trade are 
amplified when millions of trades are made in a year .
The empirical evidence is abundant and covers both position data and 
return information. At my firm, we have separately managed accounts with 
both quant and discretionary equity firms. On an average day , 30 percent of 
the quants’ positions are held in opposite directions on the exact same names. 
This belies the notion that quants are all the same, especially since only about 
75 percent of their positions are even in the same country . In other words, of 
the positions held in the same country , about 40 percent are held in opposite 
directions by various quant traders. As the number of traders is increased, this 
ratio naturally also increases. This has been confirmed by several studies. In 
2008, Matthew Rothman, then of Lehman Brothers, produced a study of 25 
of the largest quant equity market neutral traders and found that approxi -
mately 30 percent of their positions were held in directions opposite those 
of someone else in the group, on average, using portfolio data spanning over 
a year . Among smaller firms, the differences are even more noticeable. With 
a third to half of all potentially overlapping positions held in opposite direc-
tions, it is difficult to accept an argument that quants are all the same. If they 
were, one quant’s long would not be so likely to be another quant’s short.

## Page 227

Criticisms of Quant Trading  207
Return data confirm what we see in the position data. I have a sample 
of a couple of dozen quant managers’ daily returns (some going back as far 
as 1997), and the average correlation of these managers to each other is 
0.03. There are only nine pairs of correlations that exceed 0.20, out of 252 
pairs in total. And during the heart of the crisis, from September through 
November 2008, this correlation was merely 0.05. By contrast, the eight 
HFRX hedge fund indices that have daily returns (i.e., ranging from con-
vertibles to risk arb and macro strategies) correlate at an average of 0.21 
to each other , and 11 of the 28 pairs correlate at greater than 0.20. Five of 
the 28 correlate at greater than 0.40, and the maximum correlation is 0.81, 
between the equity hedge and event‐driven styles.
The same basic story is told by monthly return data. Measuring the 
correlations of some 53 quant equity market neutral traders with at least 
25 months of return history, we find that the average correlation among 
them is 0.13. Note that we did not even include quantitative futures trading, 
which would reduce the correlation still further . By contrast, 22 Hedge Fund 
Research Inc. (HFRI) hedge‐fund‐style indices (excluding the broader HFRI 
hedge fund and fund of funds indices and excluding the short‐selling man-
agers) correlate at an average of 0.48 to each other , and these span styles as 
diverse as macro and distressed debt. The data are strongly in opposition 
to the idea that all quants are the same, confirming what we would expect, 
given a basic understanding of how quant trading strategies are actually 
developed.
o nl y a Few l a R ge Quan T s c an Th R i V e in T he l ong Run
I’ve heard this criticism repeated countless times by various observers of the 
quant trading world. The argument is reasonable enough at first glance, and 
it goes something like this: The largest and best‐funded quants can throw 
the most and best resources at every aspect of the black box, from data to 
execution algorithms, and can negotiate better terms with their service pro-
viders. Based on this premise, it is reasonable to expect that, in the long run, 
they will outperform their smaller cousins. Ultimately, smaller quant firms 
will fall by the wayside due to either underperformance or investor attrition. 
The best shops, furthermore, are so good that they ultimately replace their 
investors’ capital with their own, leaving the investor who desires to invest 
in quant trading in a quandary: Should she select smaller , inferior shops and 
be able to keep money with them until they go out of business? Is it better 
to invest in a handful of the biggest quants while that is still possible, and if 
they kick out their investors later , so be it? Or is it best to simply avoid this 
space altogether , since the two other options are unattractive?

## Page 228

This criticism and its corollaries are interesting theoretically but ignore 
many important facts about quant trading and therefore draw an incorrect 
conclusion. First, as evidenced very clearly in August 2007 and throughout 
2008, having a large amount of money to manage is not always good, be-
cause readjustments to such large portfolios can be extremely costly in times 
of stress. In other words, one sacrifices nimbleness while gaining size.
Second, whole classes of very appealing strategies are made impossible 
or impractical for the largest quants because the amount of money that can 
be effectively managed in those strategies is too small to be worth the effort. 
For example, large quants rarely engage in statistical arbitrage in markets 
such as Australia or Hong Kong because they cannot put enough money to 
work there. High‐frequency trading in any market has very limited capac-
ity and is therefore a very uncommon component of a large quant trader’s 
portfolio.
Third, there is reasonable evidence that smaller hedge funds actually 
outperform larger funds.
3 Some observers believe this is partly because 
smaller shops are headed by entrepreneurs who are hungry to succeed 
rather than already successful managers who can become complacent or 
uninvolved. Regardless, there isn’t a particularly good reason to believe that 
the lack of resources any small trader faces, relative to those who are much 
larger and trade similar strategies, is any more an impediment for quants 
than for discretionary traders. As one small discretionary trader put it, “It’s 
not like I’m going to get the first call when a broker has useful information 
about a company. I just have to work harder and find things on my own. ” 
In other words, though there is evidence that smaller managers outperform 
larger ones, there is no reason to distinguish smaller quants from smaller 
discretionary shops. Both face challenges that larger shops don’t, and both 
must find ways to cope with them.
Fourth, smaller managers tend to focus on the kinds of things they 
know and understand best, whereas larger managers need to diversify into 
areas that are increasingly far from their core expertise in order to grow 
to such large size. Most very successful trading strategies have somewhat 
limited capacity for capital under management. As such, to build on success, 
a larger trader must incorporate other strategies, which might not be at all 
similar to the ones in which the original success was achieved. This was 
certainly the case with LTCM and Amaranth; it is also the case with more 
successful large hedge funds such as D. E. Shaw, Caxton, and Citadel. Some 
of these have managed a wide diversity of strategies better than others, but 
the evidence in favor of large multistrategy hedge funds is mixed at best.
Fifth and finally, the vast majority of the quality of a quant strategy is 
determined by the good judgment and sound research process of the people 
in charge. Therefore, it is absolutely the case that one good quant, with 

## Page 229

Criticisms of Quant Trading  209
significant applied science and/or trading experience and sound judgment, is 
worth dozens of PhDs who lack these traits.
A related point bears mentioning here: Ever since the Industrial Revolu-
tion, there has been a trend toward specialization in all variety of businesses. 
In quant trading, this usually means that the bigger firms tend to hire people 
with very specific skill sets to fill very specific roles. However , I have seen a 
great deal of (admittedly anecdotal) evidence that this may be suboptimal. 
Instead of having a mathematician who doesn’t understand software devel-
opment (or hardware issues, or network optimization) and may not have a 
great deal of trading expertise or experience, it may be better to have sen-
ior partners whose skill sets span multiple areas relevant to quant trading 
(math, computer science, and finance).
There is often a loss of information that accompanies communication 
between specialists in one area and specialists in another . It is easy to ver -
ify this phenomenon by sitting in any meeting that includes participants 
of widely varying backgrounds. The jargon is almost always different, the 
approach to communicating can be different, the assumptions are often dif-
ferent, and, perhaps most importantly, the understanding of what problems 
can be solved (and what can’t be solved) by people in other fields is simply 
not at a high enough level to maximize the efficiency of communication 
between specialists of differing fields.
I can distinctly remember my first job in the finance industry as a sum-
mer intern in a group that built technology for trading desks. An enormous 
amount of energy was expended trying to plug the holes in communica-
tion between programmers, statisticians, and traders, and this energy was 
often spent in vain. This is not an indictment of that particular group: It 
is a well‐known problem endemic to any field that requires expertise from 
a multitude of disciplines. On the other hand, a great deal of creativity is 
inspired by the application of techniques from one discipline into another . 
This is most easily seen in the rise of quant trading itself. Applications of 
techniques from computer science, physics, statistics, genetics, game theory, 
engineering, and a huge number of other fields have found their way into the 
capital markets. Individuals who have expertise in a number of disciplines 
obviously have an easier time applying techniques across those disciplines.
I have certainly seen firsthand reasonably compelling evidence that a 
portfolio of boutique quant traders can be built that is productive and com-
petes favorably with a portfolio of larger quant managers. There are also a 
number of quants who are not among the largest but who certainly have 
sufficient resources to tackle many of the same advanced problems that the 
largest shops can consider . For example, the smallest firms most often rely 
on data vendors, but some small boutiques actually collect and clean their 
own data, something that it is widely assumed that only the largest firms can 

## Page 230

210  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
do. Both theoretically and empirically, there is little evidence to support the 
idea that only the largest quants can survive.
This is not to say that the largest firms are without advantages. Those 
pluses outlined at the beginning of this section are certainly valid, for exam-
ple. But the case in favor of larger quants is far from airtight, and equally 
strong arguments can be made for boutiques. The good news is that there 
are many hundreds of them from which to choose.
In short, we find that there is no substantial difference in quality be-
tween smaller and larger quants. There are some larger quant firms that 
invest their resources into better infrastructure. Others may not. There are 
some smaller firms that have a great deal of expertise and firepower , despite 
their size. Others suffer from the lack of resources. We find that it boils 
down to an evaluation of managers bottom up, and that there is no valid 
top down evidence that either larger or smaller quants have an advantage 
over the other . The evaluation of managers is a topic we will save for the 
next chapter .
Quan T s aR e g uil T y o F  d a T a Mining
Data mining is given a fairly bad name in financial circles. It is used in -
terchangeably with another term that is actually deserving of such nega -
tive judgment: overfitting. Data mining is an empirical science, to borrow 
again from the framework of the two major kinds of science we discussed 
in Chapter 6. Data‐mining techniques are generally understood to use 
large sets of data for the purpose of deriving information about what hap -
pens without worrying about why it happens. This is the biggest difference 
between data mining and theory‐driven science: Theorists are interested 
in understanding why something happens in order to believe that they 
can correctly forecast what will happen. However , as we already learned, 
theorists, too, look to historical data for clues about what kinds of theo -
ries might explain what has happened. This is a fine line—fine enough that 
it is not entirely clear that there is a valid difference between well‐done 
empirical science and well‐done theoretical science. The only discernible 
difference is that, in theoretical science, a human is expected to derive an 
explanation that seems reasonable to other people, whereas in empirical 
science, the method of analyzing data is the primary subject of scrutiny. In 
other words, nearly everyone mines data, even if only loosely. This is not 
problematic. We would not have heard that cheap stocks outperform ex -
pensive ones unless someone had some data to support the idea. If the data 
were overwhelmingly opposed to such a statement, no one would espouse 
it as a valid approach to investing.

Data mining is very successfully used in many industries in the broader 
economy and society. In the defense industry, data mining is widely used in 
terrorism prevention. No doubt you have heard of the U.S. government’s 
efforts to scan millions of phone calls and e‐mails for information to help 
predict and therefore help stop terrorist attacks. The government does not 
have individuals sitting on phones listening into each conversation or at 
computer terminals reading e‐mails. Rather , computer algorithms are used 
to discern defined patterns that are expected to be fruitful in rooting out 
potential terrorist activities.
We have already given several other examples of successful data mining 
in this chapter . Amazon.com uses data mining to advise you of what kinds 
of books you might like, given what you’ve purchased and viewed. Ana-
lytical customer relationship management (CRM) software packages help 
businesses maximize profit per contact by mining data on these contacts, to 
allow sales personnel to focus on the most lucrative clients and spend less 
time on less lucrative prospects. Human resources departments use data‐
mining tools to discern which universities produce the best employees (the 
“goodness” of an employee is based on measures of her productivity and 
quality). Scientists, too, are heavy users of data‐mining techniques. This is 
particularly evident in the field of genomics, where patterns of genetic infor-
mation lead to linkages between specific genes and human health and be-
havior . So, it might not be entirely fair to claim that data‐mining techniques 
cannot be used on market data, given their wide use and success in so many 
social and hard sciences. But, perhaps more importantly, as we showed in 
Chapter 3, most quants aren’t interested in data‐mining strategies. They are, 
instead, utilizing strategies based on strong underlying economic principles. 
Many are very careful about fitting parameters and other aspects of the 
quant research process that lend themselves to data mining. In short, data 
mining doesn’t deserve as bad a name in finance as it has received, but it’s 
largely a moot point since most quants aren’t data mining in the first place.
Overfitting is another story entirely. Overfitting a model implies that 
the researcher has attempted to extract too much information from the 
data. With a sufficiently complex model, it is possible to explain the past 
perfectly. But what is the likelihood that a perfect explanation of the past, 
using an overly complex model, will have any relevance to the future? It 
turns out that the answer is: not bloody likely. Imagine that we find out that 
the S&P 500 dropped an average of 1 percent anytime the Federal Reserve 
announced a decision during some period. But we have only a handful of 
observations of the Fed making announcements, and all their announce-
ments during the historical period were of the Fed announcing rate hikes. 
We could, if we were overfitting, draw a conclusion that Fed announcements 
are always bad, and this conclusion would be successful so long as future 

## Page 232

212  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
Fed announcements are met with the same reaction as past announcements. 
But what happens if the next Fed announcement is of a lowering of interest 
rates? It’s very likely the strategy would lose money because it was fitted to 
a sample that primarily included rate hikes. Therefore, we should be con-
cerned about overfitting the data.
As an experiment, I set up a new Amazon.com account and idly clicked 
on a handful of books of interest to me. The recommendations that came back 
were not nearly as good as those that I’m given from my main Amazon.com 
account, since my main account is based on a lot of real data, whereas the 
new account is based on information from fewer than 20 observations of 
my clicking on various titles. The recommendations in my new account are 
likely to be overfitted, whereas those in my old account are less likely to be 
overfitted.
T o estimate a given parameter of a model, one needs rather a lot of data. 
Overfitting ignores this basic fact and burdens a limited supply of data too 
much, asking it to explain more than is realistic, given the amount of data. 
These models are finely tuned to the past, but the moment that the future 
is out of step with the past, the model breaks down. In quant finance, the 
inevitable outcome of overfitting is losing money. There is no question that, 
when it is found, overfitting should be eliminated. But it is a gross and in-
correct generalization that all quants overfit their models. Those most likely 
to be guilty of overfitting are data‐mining quants. And among data‐mining 
strategies, I find that a useful rule of thumb is that shorter timescales tend to 
be more amenable to data mining than longer timescales.
First, this might be because there are so many more observations of 
trades at short time horizons, and therefore the amount of data available for 
analysis is increased. If a strategy holds positions for a year , on average, it 
would take hundreds of years to be comfortable with any substantial statis-
tical analysis of the strategy’s returns, because the number of betting periods 
is so small. If, by contrast, a strategy trading U.S. stocks holds its positions 
for one minute, there are 390 trading periods per day (because there are 390 
minutes per trading day) and about 100,000 trading periods per year (be-
cause there are 250 to 260 trading days per year and 390 minutes per trad-
ing day) per stock. If 1,000 stocks are traded, there are about 100 million 
trading periods per year to observe, yielding a great deal more data that can 
be mined. Remember , the problem of overfitting arises when the model is 
too complicated for the amount of data available. The more data are made 
available, the less likely it is that overfitting has occurred for a given level of 
model complexity.
Second, at very short timescales it is not clear that theoretical scientists 
have yet come up with useful explanations of behavior . A practical guideline 
is that, for strategies with holding periods of less than a day, data‐mining 

## Page 233

Criticisms of Quant Trading  213
strategies might be fairly useful. For strategies with holding periods on the 
order of a week, a hybrid approach that combines data‐mining techniques 
and sound market theory can be useful. Finally, strategies that expect to 
hold positions for months or years are not likely to work if they rely on 
data‐mining techniques.
Overfitting models is not only possible, it actually happens among some 
quant traders. But just as we do not reject analysis because some people are 
prone to overanalyzing things, we should not so quickly dismiss quantita-
tive modeling (even data mining) just because it is possible (or even easy) for 
some people to do it badly.

Quant trading is no elixir , and certainly there are quants who are guilty of 
each or all of the criticisms discussed in this chapter . Some do bad science, 
underestimate risk, and lose money when market conditions change suddenly . 
Some implement strategies that are commonplace and crowded, and some 
overfit their models to limited amounts of data. But most of these criticisms 
are equally applicable to discretionary traders. Done well, quant trading can 
produce superior risk‐adjusted returns and substantial diversification benefits.
So, what does it mean to do quant trading well? We will cover this 
topic in depth in the next chapter , but let’s recap some salient points from 
this chapter: Quants must be concerned with falling prey to the temptation 
of false precision, particularly in risk management. A printout with a risk 
number on it does not imply that the number is accurate or has been prop-
erly derived. Quants must also remain aware of relationships within the 
market and must have a detailed understanding of the kinds of bets they are 
making and how they are expressing these bets in their portfolios, allowing 
them to navigate violent regime changes. Quants must conduct innovative 
research in alpha modeling and across the entire spectrum of the black box, 
to reduce the risk that there is substantial overlap between their models and 
those of their peers. Finally, to the extent that data mining is explicitly uti-
lized, it should be done in a manner that does not express overconfidence in 
the amount and predictive power of historical data.

I
n this chapter we discuss methods of assessing quant strategies and prac-
titioners to separate the good from the mediocre and the mediocre from 
the poor . As I have said throughout this book, a great deal of the work that 
quants do has very natural analogues in discretionary trading. There are 
also significant parallels in the work of a quant trader to the work of a cor-
porate CEO or any other person involved in the allocation of resources. In 
this regard, the framework presented in this chapter can be used successfully 
to judge the work of such decision makers. Indeed, one person I trained in 
this method of assessing quants has adapted it for trading credit markets 
and now uses the same method to provide a framework for judging the 
merit of various corporate bond offerings and the companies behind them.
The first challenge an evaluator of quants faces is to pierce the walls of 
secrecy that quants build around their methods. Though it is fair to say that 
quants are often secretive, I have had a rather different experience. The vast 
majority of quants I have evaluated—and there have been many hundreds 
of them—have been willing to answer most or all of my innumerable ques-
tions. The difference is due, at least in part, to the questions we ask at my 
firm. It also owes to how we ask these questions and how we handle the in-
formation we learn from quants. In the next section, I describe the principles 
of my approach to interviewing quants.
Armed with the techniques described in this chapter , the evaluator of a 
quant has two goals. The first is to understand the strategy itself, including 
Chapter 12
e valuating Quants and  
Quant Strategies

## Page 236

216  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
the kinds of risks it is taking and from what sources its returns are gener -
ated. This is important because it tells the investor what she owns when she 
is investing in a given quant strategy. The second goal in the evaluation of 
a quant is to judge how good the practitioners themselves are. In many re-
spects, a quant trading team is much like an engineering team at an automo-
bile manufacturer . It is fine for the team to build one great engine, but over 
time, that engine must be improved. As times change, the engine might even 
need to be redesigned entirely, or other types of engines might need to be 
designed for other vehicles. It is critical to ascertain whether the quant team 
is skilled at designing engines, evolving them, and designing new types of 
engines over time. All these components of the analysis of a quant ultimately 
serve to help the evaluator answer perhaps the most central question in the 
evaluation of any kind of trader: Why should I believe that this particular 
team, utilizing this particular strategy, is actually likely to make money in 
the future? In hedge fund parlance, what is this manager’s edge?
Assuming that the investor finds a team and strategy worthy of invest-
ment, he must ascertain the integrity of the people involved. After all, skill is 
a good thing only if it is in the hands of good people. Here I briefly address 
some thoughts on how to judge the integrity of a trader , although this is not 
central to quantitative trading. Finally, I provide a few brief thoughts on 
portfolio construction using the frameworks provided in this book.
Gather I n G  Informat I on
How does one actually go about finding out what a particular quant does? 
Quants are notorious for their secrecy and paranoia. And this is not with-
out reason. Much of the skill of quant trading comes from experience and 
know‐how, not from raw mathematical superiority. There is an excellent 
book called The Interrogator , by Raymond T oliver , from which many useful 
lessons can be learned on how to get information from a quant.
1 The book’s 
subject is Hanns Joachim Scharff, a former World War II Luftwaffe inter -
rogator who succeeded at gathering information from downed Allied pilots 
without the use of any physical force or psychologically stressful techniques. 
Instead, Scharff used three major tools: trust building, domain knowledge, 
and an organized system for tracking and retrieving information.
Before detailing Scharff’s techniques, I want to stress that I am no fan 
of wars or interrogations, nor does the relationship between investor and 
quant manager closely resemble the relationship between interrogator and 
prisoner . But there is one similarity, I believe, that allows lessons from the 
latter to be useful in the former: In both cases, information that one party is 
reluctant to provide is needed by the other .

## Page 237

Evaluating Quants and  Quant Strategies  217
The first technique Scharff used is also the most obvious: He built trust 
with the pilots he was interviewing. In fact, Scharff remained friends with a 
great many of them after the war , and they seemed universally to respect and 
like him. Turning to the quant, trust comes in part from building relation-
ships, but a big chunk of it relates to the behavior of the interviewer . If an 
investor asks a quant for sensitive information and has either a reputation 
for talking, or an actual propensity to talk about what other quants do, it is 
less likely that the quant will or should trust this investor . After all, whatever 
the quant tells him is likely to get spread around the industry. At my firm, 
we hold quant managers’ strategies in the strictest confidence. Often a quant 
will ask us what some other quant does. Our answer is universally and al-
ways that we will not discuss what others do, just as we do not discuss what 
the quant who asked us does. However , we’ve heard numerous stories and 
witnessed numerous firsthand examples of investors or managers passing 
along even reasonably proprietary bits and pieces of a quant’s strategy to the 
industry. This is an ugly practice.
The second lesson from The Interrogator is that it is hard to feel particu-
larly justified in being secretive with information if the person asking ques -
tions already knows most of the possible answers. For example, Scharff knew 
the name of the pet dog at the home base of one pilot and the names of most 
of the pilot’s colleagues. His goal in a given interview was to learn just a little 
bit more about his prisoners and their activities. They were frequently lulled 
into thinking that there was no point in keeping secrets, since their captor 
knew so much already . Though this never led to blatant tell‐all behavior , it 
certainly allowed the interrogator to amass huge amounts of value from the 
interviews, a little at a time. It is possible to learn a similarly voluminous 
amount about quant trading without asking any particular quant to teach 
it to you in a meeting. This is helped along by the fact that most of what an 
investor needs to understand about a quant can be learned without compro-
mising proprietary information. In this book, for example, we have outlined 
a great majority of the kinds of approaches quants use. None of this informa-
tion is especially proprietary to any trader . A quant with any hope of being 
successful knows most of the material in this book already . In a sense, this 
book provides you with a great portion of the menu available to a quant. 
There aren’t many dishes he can choose that aren’t on this menu, which obvi-
ates the need for most of the secrecy . The investor can, in this way , learn about 
the specific items on the menu that the quant being interviewed has chosen 
and why these choices were made. For instance, understanding the kinds of 
alpha models the quant is using, whether they are relative or intrinsic, how 
fast he trades, and in what instruments and geographies tells the investor a 
great deal about what risks are being taken. This information is necessary for 
building a diversified portfolio and is largely sufficient for that exercise.

## Page 238

The third and final lesson of The Interrogator is to be organized in the 
management of information when it is gathered. This greatly supports ef-
forts to get new information but is also useful in ongoing evaluations of the 
quality of a given practitioner . Scharff’s group developed a sophisticated, 
almost relational database system using index cards and a card catalogue 
file. (Remember , this was before the computer was invented.) As they got 
new information, they would organize it by linking it to other relevant cards 
in the file. For example, if they found out the name of another pilot from 
a given American base, they would tag that card with references to all the 
other information, including other pilots, from that base. This way, as they 
were interviewing a given pilot, they had a dossier that contained an impres-
sive and extensive array of details, well organized and easy to access. These 
days we have powerful computers and databases to rely on, making such a 
job easier .
Keeping information organized furthers the goal of developing deep do-
main knowledge, but it is also quite useful in ascertaining the “goodness” of 
a quant team over time. If every three months you ask a quant, for example, 
what types of research projects he is working on and what new pieces he 
has added to the model over the past three months, over time you should 
see a rational life cycle that repeatedly takes a robust research pipeline and 
turns it into implemented improvements to the strategy. If the quant has a 
process wherein modules that were not part of the research list from the 
past suddenly appear in production, this could be evidence of sloppiness in 
the research process. When visiting a quant’s office, it is useful to ask to see 
firsthand some of the various tools and software that the quant claimed to 
use or to have developed in previous discussions. But, even to know that you 
should be asking to see something specific, you already had to have carefully 
managed the information about the nature of these tools and software.

In my years of evaluating and creating quant trading strategies, I have noted 
an extraordinarily interesting fact: The work that a quant does is, in most 
ways, identical to the work that any portfolio manager , any CEO, or any 
other allocator of resources must perform. After all, these resources (e.g., 
time or money) are limited and must be invested in a way that results in 
maximum benefit. The process used to invest resources—the investment 
process—contains six major components:
	 1.	 Research and strategy development
	 2.	 Data sourcing, gathering, cleaning, and management

## Page 239

Evaluating Quants and  Quant Strategies  219
	 3.	 Investment selection and structuring
	 4.	 Portfolio construction
	 5.	 Execution
	 6.	 Risk management and monitoring
You may note that these activities are closely parallel to the modules of 
the black box and the activities in and around its construction and manage-
ment. This is because all these areas must be addressed in order for a quant 
trading program to function properly over time. One fact about computers, 
which we’ve mentioned already, is that they do not do a good job of think-
ing about things you might have missed. As quant trading programs have 
evolved over time, they have had to address the myriad decisions that any 
portfolio manager must address. T oo often, in discretionary management 
activities, important aspects of this process are left without sufficient analy-
sis, and an ad hoc approach is taken. I’ve interviewed scores of discretionary 
stock pickers who can spin tremendous yarns about why they are long this 
stock or short another . But when asked how they decide how to size these 
positions in their portfolios, the answers are often vacuous, given without 
deep thought or analysis.
Those charged with evaluating managers must thoroughly examine each 
of these areas. And quants, in general, should be willing to answer questions 
about each. A few examples of the kinds of questions I ask a quant follow:
■■ Research and strategy development
■■ How do you come up with new ideas for trading strategies?
■■ How do you test these ideas?
■■ What is your approach to fitting the model, as well as your approach 
to in‐sample and out‐of‐sample testing?
■■ What kinds of things are you looking for to determine whether a 
strategy works or not?
■■ Data sourcing, gathering, cleaning, and management
■■ What data are you using?
■■ How do you store the data, and why that way?
■■ How do you clean the data?
■■ Investment selection and structuring
■■ Can you describe the theory behind your alphas?
■■ Which types of alpha are you using (e.g., trend, reversion, technical 
sentiment, value/yield, growth, or quality)?
■■ Are you making relative bets or directional bets?
■■ If relative, what does relative mean, exactly?
■■ Over what time horizon, and in what investment universe, do you 
apply your alpha model?

## Page 240

220  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
■■ How are you mixing your various alpha models?
■■ Portfolio construction
■■ How do you do portfolio construction, which is to say, how do you 
size your positions?
■■ Are there limits, and why did you set them that way?
■■ What are the inputs to your portfolio construction model?
■■ What are you trying to achieve with portfolio construction (i.e., what 
is your “objective function”)?
■■ Execution
■■ What kind of transaction cost model are you using, and why did you 
choose to model transaction costs the way you did?
■■ How are you executing trades—manually or algorithmically?
■■ Tell me about your order execution algorithms: What kinds of things 
did you build into them (e.g., hidden vs. visible, or active vs. passive)?
■■ Risk management and monitoring
■■ What does your risk model account for , and why those things?
■■ What are your various risk limits, and why did you set them where 
you did?
■■ Under what circumstances would you ever intervene with your model?
■■ What are you monitoring about your strategy on an ongoing basis?
This is but a sampling of the hundreds of questions I ask a quant. If he 
claims that the answers to such questions are proprietary, I do not simply 
accept that response. Rather , I try to ascertain why he thinks the answers 
are proprietary and try to make him understand why I need to know. 
Most quants I have met are sympathetic to the goals of an investor trying 
to understand whether that trader’s approach and the commensurate ex -
posures that it yields are beneficial to the investor’s portfolio’s exposures 
and whether the quant is skilled at his work. In other words, the overall 
justifications for all the questions one needs to ask about a systematic 
trading strategy are as follows. First, the investor must understand what 
the strategy is, in order to ascertain whether it is desirable for his portfolio 
to be exposed to the strategy’s risks. Second, the investor must ascertain 
whether the manager implementing the strategy is actually doing it well 
enough to deserve an allocation of capital, which we address in the next 
section. Success in the endeavor of evaluating quants ultimately is driven 
by building trust, having domain knowledge, and being organized in the 
management of information. As I’ve said, the menu of things that quants 
can choose to do is reasonably easy to know. It is largely laid out in this 
book, and I am certain I’ve revealed nothing proprietary. A quant gener -
ally should not claim that he cannot disclose which items he has chosen 
from this menu.

Evaluating Quants and  Quant Strategies  221
The investor has one more tool available for understanding a quant 
strategy, and that is the footprint left behind by the strategy: its return his-
tory. Imagine that an investor learns, by asking questions such as those I’ve 
listed, that a quant is using a trend‐following strategy on various individual 
instruments, with a six‐month average holding period. When long‐term 
trends are present, the strategy should do well. When longer‐term trends 
reverse, the investor should see the strategy do poorly. In other words, the 
strategy’s return pattern should corroborate the fundamental understanding 
that the investor has gained by asking many questions.
e valuat I n G  the aC umen of Quant I tat I ve t rader S
If I have tried to stress anything in this book, it is that the judgment of 
a quant trader pervades the strategy she builds. So, an evaluation of the 
quant’s skill and experience in the fields relevant to the trading strategy 
is obviously important, but it is also easier said than done. This section 
outlines a few tools that can be used to determine the skill level of quant 
traders.
The people developing and managing quant strategies should be well 
trained in the methods they use. At least some members of the team should 
have substantial live experience in areas of quant trading relevant to the 
strategy they are currently pursuing. Experience helps drive good judgment, 
especially in light of the massive array of subtleties and traps inherent in the 
process of research and trading. From a dispositional standpoint, quants 
should be careful and cautious in their analysis, and they must be humble 
about their ability to predict the future. There are considerable hurdles to 
doing quant trading well, such as polluted data and constantly improving 
competition. A good quant does not underestimate such challenges, nor 
does she overestimate her ability to meet them. The reality is, however , that 
evaluating whether scientists know what they are talking about at a deep 
level is not the easiest task for someone who is not technically proficient. As 
such, to make a judgment, one may have to rely on the quant’s qualifications 
and experience, reputation, history of success, and analyses of the invest-
ment process. Although this is a lot of work, the task is doable for those who 
want to undertake it.
One of the handiest tricks I know of to evaluate a quant’s skill is to dig 
deeply into the details in a few areas of her process. Why? The difference be-
tween success and failure is very commonly found in a large number of highly 
detailed decisions. If the mechanism used to make these decisions is flawed, 
the manager has little hope of success in the long run. Thus, an analysis of the 
investment process, and by extension its six major components, is focused on 

## Page 242

222  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
understanding what a quant does and, just as important, why the quant does 
it. As we discussed throughout this book, a number of approaches to quant 
trading can deliver acceptable risk‐adjusted returns. Momentum and mean 
reversion strategies can both work, even though they are opposites. Both in-
trinsic alphas and relative alphas can work. So it is important to understand 
what a trader does, but why she does it tells you about her judgment, her 
process, and her potential for future success.
Each decision a quant makes in how she builds a strategy represents 
a source of potential differentiation from other traders, but also of po-
tential success or failure. And it makes sense that this should be the case. 
Many quants have large numbers of positions, frequently in the thousands, 
and most engage in strategies that turn these positions over relatively fre-
quently—from once every few minutes to once every few months. If 5,000 
positions are turned over once a week, for example, this represents about 
260,000 individual trades per year . Now imagine two equity traders, Trader 
A and Trader B. They have remarkably similar strategies, even in the details, 
and they each manage $500 million. For each dollar managed, they put on 
$2 of long positions and $2 of short positions so that each trader has a port-
folio of $2 billion. Each turns over about 20 percent of her portfolio per day, 
or $400 million in dollar volume each day. They each average 10 percent re-
turns per year . If Trader A is later able to optimize her executions such that 
she makes 0.01 percent more per dollar traded than she used to—either by 
being faster or reducing transaction costs or improving the alpha model—
this results in Trader A ’s annual return improving to 12 percent per year . 
This is 20 percent, or $10 million per year in profits, better than the result 
generated by Trader B, which is an enormous difference when compounded 
over time. Though some quants certainly do things that are plainly incor -
rect at a high level, the judgment of the quality of a given quant most often 
comes down to her decisions at a fairly detailed level.
Another reason that the details matter so much is that there is really 
only a tiny amount of predictability in all the movements of the market. 
Quants often depend on being right only slightly more often than they are 
wrong and/or on making only slightly more on winning trades than they 
lose on losing trades in order to generate profits (though trend-following fu-
tures strategies tend to lose as much as 70 percent of the time, with dramati-
cally larger payoffs on the winners than the losses suffered on the losers). As 
such, small decisions that affect the probability of winning only slightly or 
those that skew the size of winning trades versus losing trades slightly can 
dramatically impact the outcome over time.
Finally, if the quant has given deep and well‐grounded thought to the 
details of the few areas that you spot‐check, it is more likely that she has 
given deep thought to other areas of the quant trading process. This, too,

improves her probability of success in the future, since we have shown that 
rigor is a key component of success in quant trading. Though it is likely ob-
vious enough already, I want to make it clear that the fact that a quant has 
a PhD in physics (or anything else) is no indication of quality or skill. Some 
of the brightest and most successful quants have no advanced degrees, and 
some of the biggest failures in quant trading have won Nobel Prizes.
The flaw in this plan of focusing on the details of a quant strategy is that 
such details are unlikely to be revealed to an investor during due diligence. 
Though the higher‐level topics discussed in the section entitled “Evaluat-
ing a Quantitative Trading Strategy” might be relatively uncontroversial to 
discuss, the details are not. As I mentioned earlier , it is frequently the details 
that separate the best traders from the mediocre ones, and these details often 
boil down to know‐how more than, say, better math skills. So, quants are 
and probably should be somewhat more reticent to provide such details. 
Even if they were to provide details, the investor would have to be knowl-
edgeable and proficient enough to pass judgment on them. In other words, 
to try to divine the quality of a quant’s system from clues about its particu-
lars requires significant experience on the part of the quant investor . After 
all, just as I require experience in my traders, I also benefit from experience 
in judging them. A great many things that seem plausible enough at first 
glance simply don’t work. For example, just because a quant pays a lot of 
money to a data vendor for clean data, it doesn’t mean that the quant should 
actually rely on the cleanliness of that data. The saving grace for the non-
quantitative investor seeking to evaluate a quant is thoroughness and strong 
information management in the assessment and due‐diligence process.
t he e d G e
In assessing a portfolio manager , including a quant, a key issue to focus on 
is the idea of an edge. We define an edge as that which puts the odds in favor 
of the portfolio manager succeeding. An edge can come from three sources, 
listed here in order of commonness:
	 1.	 The investment process
	 2.	 A lack of competition
	 3.	 Something structural
In investing and trading, an edge is not the same thing as a competitive 
edge. A trader might have absolutely no competitors, yet still manage to 
lose money. I’ve seen it more than once. An investment edge is thus more 
intrinsic than comparative. Still, competition does matter: A valid idea with 

## Page 244

224  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
a valid implementation might make little or no money if there is too much 
competition, whereas a mediocre strategy might make money if there is 
none. As such, one must ascertain the sustainability of a given trader’s edge. 
The odds might be in the trader’s favor today but against him tomorrow as 
the world changes or as competition increases, if the trader does not evolve.
An investment process edge must come from one or more of the six 
components of the investment process we just outlined. T oo often, when 
asking a discretionary stock picker what his edge is, we hear him say, “Stock 
picking. ” But this is merely an invocation of the activity, not evidence that 
this particular trader is any good at it. One must dig further into the reason 
that the trader claims to have an edge in any of these activities. For quant 
traders, most often an investment edge comes from experience and skill 
in conducting research and/or the acquisition or cleaning of data. This is 
because the goodness of the models for investment selection and structur -
ing, portfolio construction, execution, and risk management is usually deter-
mined by the quality of the research and development process that created 
them. If some modules have not been particularly well researched, there is 
almost no chance that the trader will have an edge in these areas. An edge 
in research can derive from superiority in talent or process, but actual expe-
rience in conducting successful research in the financial markets is usually 
critical. In other words, one must have better people and/or a better process 
to put around these people, but in either case experience is needed.
I have already described a bit about how to assess the people at a quant 
shop, but one more point bears mentioning. How a quant deals with ad-
versity is critical to understanding his edge and its sustainability. There are 
times when the model simply doesn’t make money. Knowing how and when 
to react to these episodes is critical. By analogy, an inexperienced or inferior 
pilot might decide to emergency‐land his plane along the way to his destina-
tion because of a little unexpected turbulence. This is clearly a bad outcome. 
By contrast, take the example of Chelsey Sullenberger , the former fighter 
pilot who was at the helm of US Airways Flight 1549 when it had an in‐air 
collision with a flock of geese about three minutes after takeoff. The plane 
lost power from both its engines. Sullenberger recognized that there would 
be no opportunity to land the plane safely along its planned southbound 
route and decided to turn north to land the plane in the Hudson River . The 
155 passengers and crew were all safely evacuated, and even the airplane 
was found more or less intact.
The analogy is not a bad one. An inexperienced quant may abandon a 
model after a little unexpected adversity. He may liquidate a portfolio or 
reduce its leverage drastically. Then, just on the basis of a small window 
of observation in which the model is performing better , he may allow the 
portfolio to accumulate positions again. But, as we’ve seen, transacting is 

## Page 245

Evaluating Quants and  Quant Strategies  225
expensive, and occasionally it leads to repercussions (as in the case of the 
August 2007 quant liquidation and the Flash Crash of 2010). T oo often 
quants react in a suboptimal manner to losses in their funds, and a knee‐jerk 
reaction can often ruin whatever edge the strategy itself has. At the other ex-
treme, a quant may not recognize when a generally valid strategy is simply 
on a crash course with total failure. One could argue that LTCM’s biggest 
mistake was forgetting Keynes’ admonition that the markets can remain 
irrational longer than an investor can remain solvent. There is a balance 
between sound fiduciary caution and being hyper‐sensitive to every bump 
in the proverbial road. A sound approach to managing adversity starts with 
good monitoring tools, which allow the quant to pinpoint problems and 
work to solve them rather than panicking. It is unlikely that a trader has an 
edge because of monitoring, but it is easy to throw away a potential edge 
through insufficient or badly conceived monitoring processes.
In terms of research, there are several hallmarks of a high‐quality proc-
ess. The process should be vigorous and prolific, and there must be an ability 
to translate models efficiently from research into production. This is because 
most quant models eventually decay into mediocrity, and successful ongoing 
research must be implemented in live trading strategies to stay ahead of this 
decay. The research process should also deal with issues such as overfitting 
and look‐ahead bias, and the evaluator should ascertain exactly how the 
quant thinks about and deals with these critical issues. Finally, the process 
should at least largely follow the scientific method. In evaluating a quant 
trader , it is useful to ask many questions about how and why various ele-
ments of their strategy are the way they are. If a manager says he will close 
a position if it has moved 10 percent against him, ask him how and why he 
decided on 10 percent rather than 5 percent or 50 percent. If the quant says 
he is running a trend‐following strategy in certain markets, find out why he 
picked a trend‐following strategy, how he defines the strategy, and why he 
is using the markets he’s using rather than other or simply more markets. 
These kinds of details will give you insight into the care with which a man-
ager has developed the entirety of an investment strategy.
A data edge can come from having proprietary access to some sort 
of data. Earlier in the book we gave the example of a company that uses 
geolocational data derived from GPS signals on cell phones to aggregate 
macroeconomic indicators that have far less lag than the typical kinds of 
figures released by governments. If, in fact, these data prove useful, they 
might be able to trade using this information, and they might then have a 
data edge. But in this era of technology and regulation, it is difficult to find 
sustainable data advantages. These advantages eventually are competed or 
regulated away. It is also possible to build a data edge through superior 
data gathering, cleaning, and storage techniques. These are, in principle, 

## Page 246

226  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
more sustainable. Again, an interviewer should ask questions about where a 
trader gets his data, what work is done to clean the data, and how and why 
the data are stored in a certain way. Some answers will be thoughtful; others 
could indicate carelessness.
This kind of data edge is quite similar to a lack‐of‐competition edge. But 
lack of competition is not a long‐term plan. It is a truism in economics that, 
if higher‐than‐average profit margins can be had in some activity , more and 
more players will compete until the margins compress and normalize at lev-
els more typical in the broader marketplace. This is likely to have happened 
already in at least two quant trading spaces: quant long/short and statistical 
arbitrage. In each of these two cases, a small number of practitioners enjoyed 
very little competition for some years. And these years produced excellent 
results. But excellent results attract a lot of attention and tend to generate 
a diaspora of lieutenants who form their own competitors to the original 
practitioner . As competition increases, the margins decrease and eventually , 
these strategies can even look “dead. ” But rather than dying, they have sim-
ply become cyclical. Thus, there are periods when players vacate the space 
because it offers too little reward, leaving more of the pie (and therefore 
better margins again) for the fewer players who remain. This cycle repeats.
In any event, in evaluating a strategy that is supposed to be without 
competition, it is also important to ascertain why there is a lack of competi-
tion. Some strategies are inherently more difficult for new entrants; others 
simply have not yet attracted the attention of new entrants. An example of 
the former , at least historically, can be found in purely quantitative options 
trading. This is not widely pursued because there are significant challenges 
associated with acquiring and cleaning data, structuring trades, and mod-
eling the liquidity of options contracts. But this by no means implies that it 
cannot later become a crowded strategy with many competing firms chasing 
an ever‐shrinking pie.
As an example of the second outcome, I remember an experienced team 
that formed a hedge fund to trade corporate credit in Asia back in 2002. 
They had successfully carried out this strategy as proprietary traders at a 
bank for several years previously. They had few, if any, competitors, and 
their early years were very strong. Then, as time passed and more entrants to 
their niche crowded the field, they had to branch into other areas that were 
less appealing. Over time their edge, which was largely related to a lack of 
competition, was eroded. Ultimately, the new areas into which competition 
forced them to participate caused a massive drawdown in their fund. The 
lack of competition was really due to a lack of discovery of their niche, and 
these are among the most fleeting kinds of edges.
Structural edges generally relate to something in the market structure 
that puts the wind in the sails of a market participant. These are usually

caused and removed by regulation. I once knew a trader in the pits of the 
New York Mercantile Exchange who ran a hedge fund that relied on his 
short‐term discretionary trading. Because of his status on the exchange, he 
was able to supplement a reasonable investment edge with a structural edge 
that allowed him to transact very cheaply and extremely quickly. Over time, 
however , his markets went from being pit‐traded to electronic, and his struc-
tural edge vanished. In quant trading, the most common sort of structural 
edge comes from liquidity provision, or the rebate, on electronic communi-
cation networks (ECNs). ECNs actually pay market participants for mar -
ket‐making activities by providing commission rebates. In certain cases I 
have seen the act of transacting become a profitable exercise for the trader , 
and this too is a structural edge. It is possible that, over time, payments by 
ECNs for order flow will dwindle, and this edge, too, will be eradicated.
e valuat I n G  Inte G r I ty
Most quants, and most traders in general, are honest and ethical. Therefore, 
it is entirely reasonable to work with them on a “trust, but verify” basis. In 
other words, for most of the evaluation process it is reasonable to assume 
that the trader went to school where she claims, got whatever degree(s) she 
claims, and is generally not a criminal. But before making an investment, 
most observers would agree that to the extent possible, it’s worth verifying 
a quant’s ethics.
Here we have a few tools at our disposal. First, do background checks, 
education verifications, and reference checks. In the case of backgrounds 
and education verifications, serious problems in a trader’s personal or pro-
fessional history should probably serve as a red flag. Of course, this is a 
tricky proposition. The investor must determine whether the mistakes or 
misdeeds in a quant’s past served to teach her a lesson, or whether they 
indicate a likely pattern of behavior that will repeat, even if not in exactly 
the same way. That judgment cannot be made universally for all cases. But 
I encourage the investor to consider this question only from one specific 
angle, which might help drive the answer: The job of the investor is not to 
judge the quant as a person but rather as a potential fiduciary, acting on be-
half of the investor . Fiduciaries are bound to act in their clients’ best interest 
and to be very open and up front about any potential conflicts of interest 
or anything else that could impede their fulfilling their duties to investors. 
Using the mentality of the fiduciary as a compass is something I have found 
helpful in a great many difficult circumstances.
When performing reference checks, I find it useful to request references 
from existing investors whenever possible and to ask them not only why 

## Page 248

228  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
they like the manager but also what they think her weaknesses are. More 
helpful still is to seek out references that the manager did not provide her -
self. It is relatively easy for any trader to find a few people to say something 
nice about her . But it is much better if the trader is known by others, and 
those others are likely to provide much more useful input than the refer -
ences a trader provides for herself. If you cannot locate such references in 
your own network, it sometimes helps to ask the references provided by the 
manager whether they know anyone else you can contact.
It turns out that getting into details with quants helps demonstrate their 
integrity as well. Though even less skilled quants might have answers at hand 
for higher‐level questions about their strategies and process, even someone 
intent on deceiving rarely thinks through low‐level details sufficiently to 
be facile in answering questions about them. This is a common and suc-
cessful interrogation technique in law enforcement. If you ask a suspected 
criminal where he was last night, it’s not surprising to hear him quickly and 
convincingly provide an alibi, such as “at my girlfriend’s house. ” But if you 
follow up by asking what time he arrived, how long he stayed, what movie 
he watched, what he ate and drank while he was there, and so on, he will 
have to make up answers to these questions he likely has not rehearsed 
beforehand.
A quant who is lying to cover up a lack of skill would have to be an 
expert at making up answers to questions about details on the fly to keep up 
with questions about the details of her strategy. And some people are very 
good liars, to be sure. However , these answers also have to be able to stand 
up on their own. Answers that reveal a lack of understanding of the subject 
matter or answers that are internally inconsistent or are deficient in other 
ways should not be ignored. They might not lead you to conclude that the 
manager lacks integrity, but they should be sufficient to conclude that she 
isn’t very good, which is itself sufficient for the purpose of avoiding hiring 
her . What’s more, you can use the same technique of looking for details in 
assessing a quant’s background as in assessing her strategy. If a quant says 
she completed her PhD at Harvard, you can follow up by asking where she 
lived while she was there, what her favorite restaurants were, who her dis-
sertation committee included, what her dissertation’s title was, how many 
pages it ended up being, and so on. And again, some of these specifics should 
be verifiable with her alma mater .
It is worth mentioning one more point about selecting managers, 
whether quant or not: Almost no trader is so special that it is worth invest-
ing in her strategy without gaining a reasonably deep understanding of it. 
It should not take much to say no, in other words, whereas it should take 
an incredible amount of confidence to say yes. Seeing a long and attractive 
track record should never be sufficient. In fact, I would put forth that it is 

## Page 249

Evaluating Quants and  Quant Strategies  229
significantly more important to get good answers to good questions than to 
see a long track record. If Bernie Madoff and the other scandals that were 
announced on a nearly weekly basis in late 2008 provide any sort of lesson 
to investors, it must be that reputation and track record are not enough.
Investors cannot validly claim that they understood how Madoff could 
have made such consistently positive returns based on the strategy he is 
said to have employed. Madoff never addressed questions, maintaining 
that his strategy (which was discretionary, not systematic) was too propri-
etary. Though insufficient to uncover all potentially fraudulent (or simply 
unprofitable) investments, the tools provided in this chapter can certainly 
help eliminate a great majority of them. These techniques should be used in 
conjunction with an equally rigorous operational due diligence process to 
further reduce the possibility of being victimized by fraud, malfeasance, or 
other misbehavior on the part of traders.
h ow Quant S  fI t I nto a p ortfol I o
Assuming that you find a quant that is worth hiring or investing in, you have 
to decide how to allocate to this trader . T o make this determination, you 
have to understand how the strategy fits in with the rest of your portfolio. 
This is largely a question of balancing the levels of various types of expo-
sures. This section details some of the more important kinds of exposures 
associated with quant investing.
a  p ortfolio of a lphas
First, it is worth remembering that portfolio construction is about allocat-
ing to exposures. A portfolio that contains more kinds of exposures is more 
diversified than one that is concentrated among a smaller number of ex-
posures. Investors must seek out the appropriate balance of trend, rever -
sion, value/yield, growth, and quality to achieve optimal diversification. A 
quant doing trend following is not likely to be so incredibly different, from 
a portfolio construction viewpoint, from a discretionary trader who is seek-
ing to identify trends. T o be sure, the tireless vigilance of a computerized 
trading strategy might find opportunities that the human trader misses. In 
addition, the human trader might avoid some bad trades that are taken 
on by the computerized strategy out of naïveté. But, as trend following in 
general goes, so it is likely that the human and computerized trader both 
go. So, at a primary level, the investor must diversify among various alpha 
exposures. In the evaluation process, the investor should be able to ascertain 
at least roughly the underlying alpha exposures of the various strategies in a 

## Page 250

230  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
portfolio. Using this information, the investor can allocate capital such that 
the blended allocations to various types of alpha are in line with the levels 
that the investor has determined are desirable.
Bet Structures
The second consideration relevant to portfolio construction is bet struc-
ture, as described in Chapter 3. Relative bets can behave very differently 
from single‐instrument bets, particularly when these bet structures are used 
with different types of alpha models. When a quant strategy makes relative 
bets, it is inherently counting on the stability of the relationships among 
the instruments that are grouped together . This makes bet structure itself 
a source of risk in such strategies, and this risk becomes evident when the 
relationship between the instruments changes. In such environments, for 
example, relative mean reversion strategies are prone to losses. On the other 
hand, single‐instrument mean reversion frequently benefits from large re-
gime changes. This is because this strategy tends to bet against the prevailing 
trend while remaining indifferent to the destabilizing effects of a large trend 
reversal on the relationships depended on by a relative alpha strategy. This 
is but one example of how bet structures can impact results and, as a result, 
the investor’s portfolio. In short, it is worthwhile to diversify across various 
bet structures as well, even within the same domain of alpha exposure (e.g., 
relative and intrinsic mean reversion).
t ime h orizon d iversification
Finally, the investor must balance her exposure across time horizons. In gen-
eral, it is my experience that longer‐horizon quant strategies—those that 
hold positions for more than a week or so—tend to go through longer and 
streakier performance cycles. They can outperform or underperform for sev-
eral quarters on end, and it can take several years to evaluate whether there 
is really a problem with the manager . Some longer‐term strategies have also 
demonstrated conclusively that they are subject to crowding risk, as seen so 
vividly in August 1998 and August 2007. While this might make them a bit 
less desirable, one can manage significantly more money in such strategies, 
which is sometimes a practical necessity.
Short‐term strategies, by contrast, tend to be very consistent performers, 
but they cannot handle much capital. They are also far from invulnerable. 
As the years since 2008 have shown, short‐term strategies require trading 
volumes to remain acceptably high, volatility to be above very low levels, 
and correlation among instruments to be below very high levels. They are 
nonetheless desirable, but also not always practical. When one does find a 

## Page 251

Evaluating Quants and  Quant Strategies  231
good short‐term trader to invest in, it is not clear that the trader will remain 
small enough to be effective on short timescales. Many traders are tempted 
to grow their assets when assets are on offer , and this demands attention on 
the part of the investor .
Summary of p ortfolio Considerations
Quants can be valuable components of a portfolio. The investor must realize 
that quants are ultimately not so different than their discretionary counter -
parts and therefore that the list of things that matter to building a portfolio 
that includes quants isn’t much different from what it would be without 
quants. As with all things related to portfolios, the key is to build a diversi-
fied portfolio that considers three important elements:
	 1.	 Various types of alpha exposures
	 2.	 Various bet structures
	 3.	 Various time horizons
It is interesting to note that these considerations closely mirror the 
taxonomy of theory‐driven alphas, presented here again as Exhibit 12.1. 
Equally interesting, I do not believe that the investment universe (asset class, 
instrument class, or geography) nor various other subtleties about the mod-
els (e.g., model specification or run frequency) are particularly impactful in 
portfolio construction. These variations add a great deal of diversity when 
markets are behaving normally, but in stressful times they simply matter a 
lot less than distinctions along the lines of the three portfolio considerations 
listed here.
Summary
T o assess a quant trader and a quant strategy, one must understand the strat-
egy being implemented and the quality and vigor of the process that gener -
ates strategies. T o do this, the investor has three weapons at her disposal: 
building trust, gaining as much knowledge as possible about quant trading, 
and keeping information she learns as organized as possible. These tools can 
be used to extract and piece together information on a given quant, and on 
quant trading generally.
Ultimately, an investor has to determine whether a quant has an edge, 
what the sources of this edge are, how sustainable the edge is, and what 
could threaten it in the future. Edges come from people and/or processes, 
and it is in these areas that the evaluation of a quant must focus. Once 

## Page 252

232  A Pr A ctic A l Guide for i nvestors in Qu A ntit A tive s tr A te G ies
quants have been vetted, they should be thoughtfully included in a portfolio. 
It is important to diversify across different approaches to alpha generation, 
different time horizons, and bet structures to complement best the other 
components of the investor’s portfolio.
I remember once interviewing a senior employee at one of the best 
quant shops in the world. I asked him how on earth they had done so well, 
which of course was a sort of stupid question. His answer , however , was 
both concise and seemingly on target. T o quote him, loosely: “There is no se-
cret sauce. We are constantly working to improve every area of our strategy.

being improved, our portfolio construction algorithms are constantly being

I’m so fast that last night I turned off the switch in my hotel room 
and was in bed before the room was dark.
—Muhammad Ali
I
n early 2009, with markets fresh off of a harrying near‐Depression ex-
perience, news reports began to circulate that among the few winners in 
financial markets in 2008 was a new breed of trading firms—so secretive as 
to make quant trading shops look like glass houses—called high‐frequency 
traders (HFTs). It didn’t take long for some in the press, political and regu-
latory circles, and even in the financial industry to begin telling a highly 
biased, basically fictional tale about high‐frequency traders.
Following these stories (which immediately prompted a chorus of cries 
of “no fair”) came an unfortunate incident involving a programmer , Sergey 
Aleynikov. Aleynikov had left Goldman Sachs to join a then-newly launched 
HFT firm called Teza (which itself was formed by former Citadel traders). 
He was arrested in early July 2009 and accused of stealing code from Gold-
man to bring with him to Teza. What was most alarming to the public about 
this case had nothing to do with Aleynikov, Goldman, or Teza (intellectual 
property theft cases are almost never of interest to the broader public). The 
prosecuting attorney—in an effort to add weight to Goldman’s allegations—
said that the software that was allegedly stolen could be used to “manipu-
late markets in unfair ways. ”

linked high‐frequency trading with market manipulation. Aleynikov ended 
up being convicted, but had his conviction overturned and vacated by an ap-
peals court after almost three years of appeals and jail time. But the damage 
was done, and the stage was set.
On May 6, 2010, U.S. equity markets collapsed and recovered dra -
matically. There was more than a 1,000 point drop in the Dow Jones, 
with about 600 points of the drop occurring in a five‐minute period that 
afternoon. This was followed by a fierce rally, which wiped out most of the 
600 point loss in only 20 minutes. The high‐speed nature of this meltdown 
and recovery came to be known as “the Flash Crash. ” The Flash Crash 
was widely blamed on HFTs, though often for contradictory reasons. 
Some claimed that HFTs caused the crash by virtue of their trades. Others 
claimed that HFTs caused the crash because they stopped trading once the 
markets became too panicked. We will address these claims in more detail 
in Chapter 16, but for now, it suffices to say that the Flash Crash was a 
major contributor to negative popular opinion about a topic that almost 
no one understands.
According to the Aite Group, HFTs now account for a little more than 
half of global equity volumes, about the same percentage of futures volumes, 
and about 40 percent of currency volumes. In equities specifically , Aite esti-
mates that HFT’s share of trading is highest in the United States (again, a little 
over half), more than 40 percent in Europe, and almost 20 percent in Asia.
2 
While there are various estimates of the exact amount of trading that comes 
from HFTs, no further evidence is needed to demonstrate that this kind of 
trading is a critically important topic to understand for any electronic market. 
It is also worth understanding how HFT relates to the kinds of quant 
strategies we explicated in Part Two. In Chapter 3, we described the types 
of strategies that are typically pursued by systematic traders. In 
 
Exhibit 3.7, 
we pointed out various implementation features related to such strategies, 
including time horizon. As we point out there, time horizons can range from 
“high frequency” to “long term. ” In general, I believe the framework pre-
sented in Part Two is quite relevant for HFT strategies, including how they 
are designed and implemented. However , there are a significant number of 
considerations specific to the shortest-term systematic strategies. In other 
words, the issues an HFT must carefully consider overlap greatly, but not 
perfectly, with the issues that concern a longer-term trader . Longer-term 
strategies often focus, for example, on managing the risk factor exposures 
of a portfolio. By contrast, high-frequency strategies tend to be concerned 
more about managing the risk of accumulating large positions.
So what is high‐frequency trading? Just as Parts One and Two showed 
that quant trading is not some monolithic idea but contains an enormously 
 
diverse constituency, it turns out that HFT is not a well‐defined, 
 
homogenous 

## Page 259

activity, either . There are multiple kinds of high‐frequency traders. But a 
definition that probably contains most of these kinds of traders is as follows: 
High‐frequency traders (a) require a high‐speed trading infrastructure, 
(b) have investment time horizons less than one day, and (c) generally try 
to end the day with no positions whatsoever . The fastest HFTs (sometimes 
referred to as ultra‐high‐frequency traders, or UHFTs) will no doubt scoff at 
the notion that someone who holds positions for as much as six and a half 
hours should be considered high frequency. But there is an important dis-
tinction between overnight risk and intraday risk, as most news comes out 
when markets are closed. Any further attempt to narrow down the holding 
period of an HFT strategy would seem arbitrary: What makes one second 
“HFT ,” while one minute is not? Furthermore, our definition specifies that 
the strategy should require a high‐speed infrastructure.
It is worth knowing, however , that HFTs share the high‐speed trading 
infrastructure mentioned above (and described in detail in the next chapter) 
with many kinds of algorithmic traders. And high‐speed infrastructure does 
not have only one speed. As we will see in the next chapter , the challenges 
facing engineers of such infrastructure are substantial, and in few instances 
does any industry standard exist to meet those challenges.
Within the algorithmic trading community, people tend to think of the 
users of high‐speed infrastructure as falling into four categories: UHFTs, 
HFTs, medium-frequency traders (MFTs), and algorithmic execution en-
gines. But all of these approaches tend to share commonalities in terms 
of the definition above (though algorithmic execution engines generally 
attempt to help acquire longer‐term positions, the algorithm itself is usu-
ally not interested in what happens tomorrow). As was famously said by 
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in 1964, “I shall not today attempt 
further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within 
that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly 
doing so. But I know it when I see it. . . . ” He was talking about hard‐core 
pornography, of course, but the exact same sentiment applies (in more ways 
than it should) to HFT .
This act of definition is important for a variety of reasons. First, it al-
lows us to have a common footing when discussing the topic. Second, there 
are implications to any definition, including this one. This definition of HFT 
implies that there are several important characteristics of HFTs. First, since 
HFTs tend to end the day with no positions (flat, in industry lingo), their 
buying and selling activity tends to exactly offset. However many shares or 
contracts were bought of a given instrument had to have been sold as well; 
otherwise, there would be a net position at the end of the day. Second, since 
there is a desire to be flat at the end of the day, an HFT strategy likely does 
not seek to accumulate large positions intraday.

## Page 260

240  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading 
As we showed in Chapter 7, accumulating large positions incurs large 
market impact costs. Unwinding such positions would cause further mar -
ket impact costs. With an intraday holding period, there is not enough 
price movement on a typical day to offset the market impact of buying, 
plus the market impact of selling. Furthermore, since HFTs cannot accu -
mulate large positions, and since price movements during the trading day 
are of limited magnitude, HFT strategies generally have fairly low profit 
margins. They must pay the same kinds of costs as other investors and 
traders—commissions, market impact, and regulatory fees, for example—
but they participate in relatively small price moves. There are economic 
incentives associated with higher volumes of trading (such as exchange 
rebates for providing liquidity or cheaper commission rates from brokers), 
but the fact is that margins remain very low, and the aggregate cost of 
technology, commissions, and regulatory fees is usually a large multiple of 
the net profits after these costs.
Multiple sources have pegged the profitability of an HFT strategy in 
U.S. equities (in relatively good times) at approximately $0.001 per share 
(one‐tenth of a penny). It is instructive to compare this to SEC regulatory 
fees of $22.40 per million dollars sold. This fee translates to about $0.006 
per share for a $70 per share stock, though it applies only to sales. Since 
HFTs tend to buy as much as they sell, we can divide the fee by two to get 
a figure that applies to every HFT transaction, and we arrive at a typical 
SEC fee of approximately $0.003 per share, which is about triple the profit 
margin for a typical U.S. equity HFT .
It is also worth understanding that an HFT who trades 100,000,000 
shares per day is responsible for more than 1 percent of U.S. equity volumes. 
His profit, at $0.001 per share, is about $100,000 per day, which comes to 
$26 million per year . If we multiply this by the 50 percent estimate of the 
share of HFT volumes versus overall market volumes, we get $1.3 billion 
in total trading profits for the entire HFT industry for an entire year in the 
largest equity market in the world. These are lofty numbers, but they are 
actually just the revenue side of the ledger .
The reality is that it also costs millions per year for every firm that tries 
to achieve these revenues, and there are a large number of firms that fail. 
And since there are a large number of firms competing, even a successful one 
that accounts for , say, 5 percent of the U.S. equity market’s volumes (which 
would make it an extraordinarily successful outlier) is making something 
like $65 million per year in revenues, before accounting for the extensive 
technological, compliance. and human resource costs that are required to 
compete.
T o put this in perspective, Apple, Inc. reported that, for the quarter end-
ing June 30, 2012, they had revenues of over $35 billion. One might argue 

## Page 261

An Introduction to High-Speed and High-Frequency Trading  241
that Apple, the largest market capitalization in the world at the moment, 
makes an unfair comparison. But even E*Trade Financial Corporation, a 
single (not particularly huge) online brokerage firm, reported that their trail-
ing 12‐month revenues as of June 30, 2012, were almost $2 billion. This is 
astounding, considering that it is generating these revenues at a time when 
trading volumes are at multiyear lows, particularly among the retail custom-
ers who form their base. E*Trade is a $2.65 billion market capitalization 
company at the time of this writing—scarcely a giant.
There is clearly “real money” to be made in HFT . However , in the grand 
scheme of things, HFT revenues are minuscule in comparison to the rev-
enues of many other kinds of companies. An interesting question, and one 
to which I have no particularly clever answer , is why so much money and so 
many smart people are so focused on this niche, considering the relatively 
diminutive size of the pie for which they are competing. But we can point 
out that many micro-industries experience an initial phase of immense prof-
itability, which in turn attracts a great many new participants. These new 
participants drive up competition, which in turn causes profit margins to 
diminish. Eventually, so many participants are competing that margins can 
turn negative. This leads to a contraction in the field, with weaker or less 
willing parties exiting. We see some evidence that this is the case in HFT , 
certainly in U.S. equities. Many HFTs who once hoped to make the kinds 
of profits that have been hyperbolized in the press have now realized that 
their firms are unable to survive on the meager revenues they can generate. 
Armed with a definition of HFT , and the background knowledge of the 
economic scope of this activity, we will proceed to explain many aspects of 
HFT . In Chapter 14, we will explain high‐speed trading, which is the basic 
toolkit for all HFT activity—and a large percentage of all other kinds of 
trading as well. In Chapter 15, we will outline HFT strategies and explain 
how they relate to the concepts introduced in Chapter 14. In Chapter 16, we 
will address some of the controversy surrounding HFT and separate truth 
from myth.

A
s we delve into the subject of high‐frequency trading, we must first clarify 
a number of important topics. Foremost among these is the difference 
between high‐speed trading and high‐frequency trading. These two concepts 
are conflated almost continuously by the press, by regulators, and even by 
reasonably savvy investors. And it is understandable, because the first, which 
is necessary and inevitable, gives rise very naturally to the second. So high‐
speed trading and high‐frequency trading are cousins, but not synonymous.
High‐speed trading is also known as low-latency trading. It refers to 
the need, on the part of various types of traders, to access the markets with 
minimal delays, and to be able to act on decisions with minimal delays. In 
this chapter , we will address why speed is important for many kinds of trad-
ers, far beyond HFTs, and also what the sources of latency are and how they 
can be addressed.
Speed has always, throughout the history of any marketplace, been an 
important part of separating weaker competitors from stronger ones. There 
is a good, self‐evident reason that equity trading firms and brokerage houses 
established themselves near the exchanges in New York, and that futures 
trading firms located themselves near the exchanges in Chicago. The same 
thing can be found in almost every market center in almost every instrument 
class around the world. Physical proximity is a good start at being fast, 
and so is having fast communications between market centers. In 1815, the 
Rothschild bank in London famously used carrier pigeons to find out about 
Napoleon having lost the battle of Waterloo. They used this information to 
go short French bonds and made an enormous sum of money. The founder 
of Reuters, one of the world’s leading news and data vendors, got his start 
Ch A pter 14

in 1845 by setting up a carrier pigeon network in London, and within five 
years, his service was the lowest latency source of information about what 
was happening in Paris’ bourses.

Why Speed M A tter S
In modern electronic markets, the best way to understand why speed mat-
ters is to see how it matters for various kinds of orders. After all, regard-
less of the types of alpha, risk, or portfolio construction models, orders are 
how strategies get implemented. While there are many kinds of orders—
 
especially when we account for all of the various kinds of exchanges around 
the world—orders can generally be understood as being passive or being 
 
active. Furthermore, some orders (passive ones) can be canceled once they 
are placed. As such, we will describe the three broad cases that capture most 
of the world’s order types as: placing passive orders, placing aggressive or -
ders, and canceling passive orders.
First, a few definitions: P assive orders are limit orders that cannot be 
immediately filled. For example, if the best offer on XYZ is 100 shares at 
$100.01, and a trader enters a limit order to buy 100 shares of XYZ at 
$100.00 or lower , this is a passive order , because it cannot be immediately 
filled. In most markets, passive orders are aggregated into an exchange’s 
“limit order book,” which shows all of the passive orders for a given ticker 
on the exchange at a single point in time. An illustration of an order book 
might look something like Exhibit 14.1.
For this hypothetical market, the limit order book shows a price/time 
priority. This means that the highest priority goes to orders at the best price 
(highest price for a buy order and lowest price for a sell order). If two orders 
have the same price, then the time at which they arrived at market is the tie‐
breaker . Other markets (for example, eurodollar futures) have a price/size

prioritization, which puts larger orders at a higher priority than smaller or-
ders at the same price (the best price would always be the first test).
Aggressive orders are immediately actionable orders. There are two ma-
jor types of aggressive orders. Market orders are always aggressive, because 
they are instructions to buy (or sell) a specific amount, without regard to 
price. Thus, if the limit order book looks like Exhibit 14.1, and a market 
order is entered to buy 3,000 shares, there would be two separate fills. First, 
the market order would use up the 2,000 share offer at $100.01 (Offer1), 
and then the market order would use up 1,000 of the shares offered at 
$100.02 (Offer2). Immediately after this trade, assuming no other orders 
have been filled, the order book would be as shown in Exhibit 14.2.
A second type of aggressive order would be a limit order made at the 
best offered price (for a buy order). Building from Exhibit 14.2, a limit or -
der to sell 1,000 shares at $100.00 would use up the first 55 shares bid at 
$100.00, and 945 of the next 1,000 shares bid at $100.00. The order book 
would now be as shown in Exhibit 14.3, assuming no other orders came in.
In this example, 55 shares (which were from Exch1 in the original ex-
ample) were filled first, and then the sell order was exhausted by taking 
945 of the Exch2’s bid at $100.00, leaving 55 shares at $100.00 as the new 
best bid. This limit order to sell was aggressive, because it was immediately 
actionable.

A couple of other terms that bear definition are joining and improving. 
T o join implies that one adds to the size of the best bid (or offer), which is 
also known as the first level of the order book, or the inside market. An ex-
ample of joining is shown in Exhibit 14.4, in which we imagine an addition-
al 1,000 shares are added to the offer side of the book at $100.02 (Offer6).
We can see that this new order has a lower priority than the 600 shares 
that were previously offered at $100.02 (Offer3), because it came in later . 
This is obviously always true of an order to join: It will always have a lower 
time‐priority. Orders to join are also always passive as they are not imme-
diately actionable.
Finally, we illustrate improving in Exhibit 14.5. Here, we see a new 
passive limit order to sell (Offer7) which narrows the bid/offer spread by 
improving the best offer price from $100.02 to $100.01. Because it has the 
best price of any offer , it receives the highest priority, even though it is the 
most recent of all of them.
Note that many practitioners tend to confuse passive orders with the no-
tion of providing liquidity, and aggressive orders with the notion of taking 
liquidity. It is an understandable mistake, because liquidity is often confused

with either volume or the size of the order book. However , as we learned 
from both the flash crash and the August 2007 quant liquidation, increased 
volumes do not always imply increased liquidity. In fact, in both instances, 
imbalances in the volumes of buys versus sells led to incredible illiquidity 
for anyone on the wrong side of those moves (for example, owners of SPY 
who wanted to sell into the downdraft on May 6, 2010). On the other hand, 
aggressive orders to buy units at a time when there are many sellers might 
be extremely additive to liquidity, even if they technically remove units from 
the order book. It is our view that this confusion stems from an inaccurate 
definition of liquidity, and this is itself understandable. Even peer‐reviewed 
academic journals have inconsistent definitions of liquidity, so it is clearly a 
concept that can be defined many ways.
We define liquidity at any point in time as being the immediate avail -
ability of units to be transacted at a fair price . This is a useful definition 
because it accounts for all of the important dimensions of the topic—
 
immediacy, size, and a fair price—without being plagued by the problems 
associated with volume or order‐book dominated approaches. It allows us 
to understand that an execution strategy to acquire a huge position mostly 
passively is still removing liquidity from the market. On the other hand, 
an aggressive order , which nominally reduces the number of units in the 
order book, is sometimes adding liquidity, if it helps push prices toward a 
fairer level.
Fairness of price deserves a brief explanation. Here, we refer to a price 
as fair if it (a) is broadly reflective of the fundamentals of the instrument’s 
underlying economic exposure, or (b) is sensible with regard to other instru-
ments that are similar to it. For example, imagine some company is massive-
ly profitable, growing nicely, and trading around $100 per share. If nothing 
changes in its business, and the price immediately drops to $2 per share, it 
is highly improbable that the test of fairness was met. In this case, we could 
say that this company’s stock became illiquid when the price moved so far 
without reason. As to the second test, if the index that the company is a part 
of, or if the other companies in its sector are moving in a similar way, then 
the price may well be fair (we explain this last concept in more detail when 
we describe HFT arbitrage strategies in Chapter 15).
With this background, we can now illustrate the importance of speed 
for passive orders to buy, passive orders to sell, and cancellations of passive 
orders. There is a single, unifying theme that bears mentioning, and it is 
known as adverse selection. This is a concept that has broad applications in 
finance (and life). Imagine that we post a job listing for a role that sounds 
perfectly standard. However , the compensation we offer is extremely low 
relative to other similar job openings that are on the market. It is probable 
that we will receive resumes mainly from below‐average candidates. This is 

## Page 268

248  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
because few self‐respecting candidates would apply for an underpaying job. 
The better candidates, and even most of the average candidates, will apply 
for the other job openings. And we, rather than drawing a random distri-
bution of good, bad, and average candidates, will be biasing our candidate 
pool toward the bad side.
Just so, in trading adverse selection is a significant problem that specifi-
cally relates to speed.
t he Need for Speed in p lacing p assive Orders
Anytime one places a passive order there is a risk of adverse selection. 
Consider what is really happening when you place a passive order: You’re 
showing the world that you’re willing to buy, for example, some number of 
shares of XYZ at $100.00. A prospective seller knows this (because your 
bid is in the order book), but you don’t know what information this seller 
might possess. That seller’s information might make you rue buying those 
shares. Of course, passive orders give the trader the opportunity to earn the 
bid‐offer spread. Furthermore, some exchanges pay rebates for filled passive 
orders, and posters of passive orders can earn additional profit by virtue of 
these rebates. According to internal research conducted by Tradeworx, it is 
estimated that the average return of all passive orders on the most liquid 
stocks (above $50 million in dollar volume per day) for the year 2010 was 
approximately –0.2 cents per share. This assumes that one can exit the trade 
at no cost (at the mid‐market price, which is the simple average of the best 
bid and the best offer , without regard to the size of the bid or offer) one 
minute after entering it. In other words, buying the bid and selling the offer 
is a money‐losing proposition in the absence of liquidity provision rebates.
So where does the need for speed come into play? Let’s start with an-
other imaginary order book for XYZ, as shown in Exhibit 14.6.
Imagine that you place an order to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at $100.00 
(Bid4). Further , let’s imagine that there are a large number of shares bid just 
after yours at the same price (Bid5). This is shown in Exhibit 14.7.

If an aggressive order comes into the market to sell 1,000 shares, you 
will be filled, and you are now long 1,000 shares of XYZ at $100.00. 
 
However , the best bid remains $100.00, because there were other orders 
behind you indicating a willingness to buy at $100.00. Here, the odds are 
not bad that you bought at a good price, at least in the extreme near term. 
This is illustrated in Exhibit 14.8.
But now let’s imagine that you place the same 1,000‐share order to buy 
XYZ, and instead of being at the top of the queue, your order is the last one 
in the book at $100.00, with thousands of shares in front of you. Orders 
to sell come into the market, and eventually, yours ends up being filled. But 
now, the best bid is lower , at $99.99 (Bid1), and most likely, the best offer 
is $100.00 (Offer6). So, yes, you did technically buy at the bid, but the bid 
immediately went down and the price you received immediately became the 
subsequent best offer . This is shown in Exhibit 14.9.
The impact of queue placement was examined empirically by 
 
Tradeworx. 
They found that there is approximately a 1.7 cents per share difference in 
the profitability of being first versus being last at a given price. This is a 
truly staggering figure, considering that all passive orders average roughly  
–0.2 cents per share.

Thus, when placing any passive order it is clear that speed is important 
to the near‐term profitability of the trade. It has been argued by some that 
long‐term investors (who hold positions for years and hope for profits on 
the order of dollars per share) should not care about the loss of a penny or 
two per share by virtue of being a slow, passive trader . But this is an over -
simplification. A pension fund with a multiyear time horizon is making a 
mistake if it ignores the cost of trading, especially if the number of shares 
transacted is very large. On the other hand, reaching the top tier of speed for 
a given market costs a great deal of money, and this does not get factored 
into simple calculations of cents per share. So there is clearly a trade‐off, and 
the need for speed among passive orders is a function of:
	 1.	 Adverse selection metrics (such as those described here)
	 2.	 Volume of shares traded
	 3.	 The cost of building and maintaining top‐tier speed
T ypically , the smaller and longer‐term the investor , the less is the need for 
higher speed. However , for many strategies (including quantitative alpha strate-
gies such as those described in this book) and many sophisticated large long‐
term funds, transaction volumes are sufficiently high as to warrant at least some 
investment in faster speeds. This explains the boom in the institutional execu-
tion technology business that has occurred since approximately 2007.
t he Need for Speed in p lacing Aggressive Orders
Traders placing aggressive orders are willing to pay the bid‐offer spread 
because they have a reason to get the trade done with more certainty. As 
we have already shown, there are two kinds of aggressive orders. One is an

aggressive limit order , which interacts with an order already resting in the 
limit order book. The other is a market order . The need for speed is different 
in each situation, and we will detail both.
In the case of an aggressive limit order , speed is important because you 
are specifying the price at which you are willing to trade, but others may 
beat you to that price. As such, the price can move away from you before 
you are able to complete your trade. Let us begin again with the order book 
shown in Exhibit 14.6. Imagine that two traders each want to buy 2,000 
shares at $100.01 and they both enter limit orders to that effect. The first or-
der to reach the market will interact with the resting $100.01 offer for 2,000 
shares. The second offer will not get filled immediately, but will become the 
new best bid at $100.01 (Bid4). This is illustrated in Exhibit 14.10.
The new best bid belongs to the second order . The first bid interacted 
with the $100.01 offer of 2,000 shares and was filled completely. If the price 
continues to climb, and the trader whose order came to market second con-
tinues to lag behind other participants, one of three scenarios may apply to 
his order: (1) it will be filled at $100.01 but is subject to adverse selection 
biases; (2) it will be filled at a higher price if he cancels and replaces with 
a higher‐priced bid; or (3) it will end up not being filled at all. In any case, 
this is a bad outcome versus simply having been the first one to bid $100.01.
The second case is that of a market order . Here, we do not have to 
worry about getting filled, as market orders will basically always be filled. 
However , with market orders we have very little control over the price of the 
fill. Speed matters here because a slowly transmitted market order suffers 
from adverse selection. If our order to buy is slow in reaching the market, it 
is less likely that there are other buyers immediately behind us, and we will 
most likely end up with a worse fill than had we been faster . (This is similar 
to adverse selection in limit orders.)
In addition, market orders also unfortunately have slippage issues. Let’s 
imagine our order is to buy 2,000 shares of XYZ, and that the order book 
is that of Exhibit 14.6. Here, if another trader’s order (a limit order to buy 
2,000 shares at $100.01, or a market order to buy 2,000 shares regardless

of price) reaches the queue and gets filled first, our market order incurs 
slippage and will be filled at $100.02. This may not be a total disaster in a 
slow‐moving market, but as we have seen in any very fast‐moving markets, 
getting filled first can have extremely large consequences in the slippage we 
pay. What’s more, the greater the accuracy of the forecasts (from the alpha 
model) that drove the desire to trade in the first place, the larger our concern 
over slippage. After all, a more accurate forecast is more likely to move in 
the direction we expect, which means that our best trading ideas are also the 
most important to implement well, when utilizing market orders.
t he Need for Speed in Canceling p assive Orders
The cancelation of passive orders that have already been placed is also high-
ly sensitive to latency. If I send a passive limit order to sell 2,000 shares of 
XYZ at $100.00, this order is simply added to the order book. Let’s imagine 
that the current best offer is to sell at $99.98, two cents better than my of-
fer . I might expect that my order will eventually get filled by virtue of some 
small fluctuation in XYZ’s price. After all, my order is only approximately 
0.02 percent away from the current best offer . However , if the market begins 
moving quickly (as it has a tendency to do at the most inopportune times), it 
is highly likely that my order will have the same adverse selection problem 
as any high‐latency order that gets placed. Thus, though I would want to 
lift my order as quickly as possible, by the time I succeed in doing so, XYZ 
might well be on its way up to well above my $100.00 offer price. If I’d been 
able to cancel this order quickly and replace it with a higher‐priced offer , I 
might have saved myself money on this trade. Similarly, if similar or corre-
lated instruments begin to rally (e.g., due to some favorable macroeconomic 
news), it is highly probable that my offer will be lifted and the price at which 
I sold would be inferior to what I could have sold at if I was (a) aware of the 
upward pressure in these other instruments, and (b) fast enough to cancel 
my current offer and replace it with a higher‐priced one.
Perhaps on one 2,000 share order , this difference is not something I 
care about. But to repeatedly suffer from adverse selection by virtue of a 
slow cancellation capability will no doubt cost me dearly over the course of 
a year . There is some controversy regarding the rate of cancelations in U.S. 
equities (and some other markets), which we will address in Chapter 16.

Having established that it is clearly important for any trader responsible for 
a reasonably large amount of volume to have access to a low-latency trading 

## Page 273

High-Speed Trading  253
platform, we now turn our attention to the potential sources of latency that 
can be controlled by the trader , and what can be done about each of these 
sources of latency.
t ransmission to and from Market Centers
The first potential source of delay for an algorithmic execution engine comes 
from the time it takes to get data from and orders to market centers. Much 
of the work of a good execution engine involves reacting quickly to changes 
in the marketplace; having as close to a real‐time access to those changes is 
logically the first order of business. Furthermore, getting your orders to the 
exchange soon after you’ve decided what to do allows orders to be fresh (as 
opposed to stale, which is what practitioners call orders that haven’t been 
refreshed very recently).
Information coming from or going to a given venue will arrive fastest 
if it is going to a location that is physically near the exchange’s matching 
engine itself. The matching engine is the software used by the exchange to 
time‐stamp and prioritize all inbound orders, provide the logic that puts 
buyers and sellers together , and broadcast the data about all of this activity. 
This software is physically housed on servers in various data centers (there 
is usually one data center per exchange). These data centers almost always 
openly offer space within the same physical location to anyone willing to 
pay for it. When a trading firm colocates its server (which contains its trad-
ing algorithms) in the same facility as an exchange’s matching engine, the 
connection between its server and that matching engine is known as a cross‐
connect. In some cases—either because a facility does not allow colocation 
or because it is too expensive to colocate in a large number of data cent-
ers—quants can elect to host nearby (with nearby being a totally arbitrary 
term here). This is known as proximity hosting.
The difference between being near the exchange and being far away 
can be material in terms of making sure that the orders that are driven off 
of that data don’t suffer from adverse selection. To put some metrics on 
it, imagine that a given market’s data center is in New York. Rather than 
colocating your servers alongside the exchange’s matching engine in New 
York, you choose to put your servers in San Francisco. A reasonable expec-
tation of the time for information to travel on a relatively fast fiber optic 
connection between New York and San Francisco is about 50 milliseconds 
each way, or about 100 milliseconds round trip. To make a decision and 
place an order , information has to travel from the exchange to your servers 
and back to the exchange. Thus the total time needed to place an order is 
about 100 milliseconds. (It will take some time to process and handle this 
information, but let’s assume that this time is negligible for now. It is in 

## Page 274

254  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
any case a constant whether you colocate in New York or use a data center 
in San Francisco.)
A lot can happen within these 100 milliseconds. For example, in the 
space of 100 milliseconds there are between zero and more than 40 mes-
sages (at the 99th percentile) posted to the various order books for EBA Y 
(just to take a single example).
2 The largest number of messages are posted 
during the more liquid times of day. This implies that almost any sensible 
trading algorithm will concentrate its activities during the times when the 
number of messages is highest. If your trading algorithm located in San 
Francisco trades during these times, your orders will be very far behind 
other orders, given the 100 millisecond delay. For this reason, we care far 
more about the message rate and activity at the 99th percentile than we do 
about the median level, for example. This is an effect we will describe in 
more detail in “Data Bursts. ”
It also bears mentioning that data handling software, order generation 
software, and everything in between resides on servers. These servers must be 
located somewhere. One possibility is to locate them on your own premises. 
In addition to the problem with latency described above, an office building 
rarely has adequate power , cooling (servers generate an extreme amount of 
heat), network speed, and emergency backup capabilities to ensure continuity . 
As such, most people locate expensive, mission critical servers in data centers 
(also known as colocation facilities). If you’re going to colocate a server , the 
least arbitrary and most useful place to do so is at or near the exchange.
t ransmission between Market Centers
Another potential source of latency for an algorithmic execution algorithm 
comes from the aggregation of data between market centers. Even for a 
single instrument class there are often multiple venues on which to transact 
these securities. For example, in the case of U.S. equities there are 13 dif-
ferent official exchanges on which investors can trade, and dozens more 
(approximately 60 as of the writing of this book) dark pools as well. When 
information arrives from multiple venues, it has to be aggregated into one 
big set of data. (Although there are services that consolidate the data for 
you, these consolidated data feeds contain substantial latency. It is far better 
to consolidate the data yourself, if you can do it well.) We will address the 
issue of consolidation separately, but in order to consolidate the data, all 
of the data have to be in one place physically. The connections between the 
various exchanges can be visualized as a mesh. As in the previous section, 
the further away a given market’s various data centers are from one another 
in the mesh, the more natural latency there is in the system, and the harder 
it is to consolidate all of the data into one place physically. All of the points 

## Page 275

High-Speed Trading  255
made in the previous section apply here: The further away a given market’s 
various data centers are from one another , the more natural latency there 
will be, and the harder it is to solve this problem.
Let us further look at the problem of consolidating data between mar -
ket centers. Many strategies look across instrument classes to make trades. 
For example, most market makers in U.S. equities (which generally trade in 
the vicinity of New York City) are very keen to know, with minimal latency, 
what the S&P E‐Mini futures contract (called the “ES” futures contract) 
is doing in Chicago. This is because the ES tends to lead both the SPY (an 
extremely important ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index) and the independ-
ently traded constituents of the S&P 500 index.
3
The most important long‐distance problems in the finance world are 
getting information back and forth between Chicago and New York, and 
between New York and London.4 Data travel at the speed of light, but the 
problem is that one must transmit data over some medium. Data can’t be 
beamed through the air (in the form of light) in a “straight line” over thou-
sands of miles due to the curvature of the earth and a wide variety of poten-
tial physical obstacles along the way (e.g., buildings, airplanes, birds). If this 
were somehow possible, it would take just under four milliseconds for data 
to reach New York from Chicago (and vice versa). As of the writing of this 
book, a typical commercially available solution for low-latency communi-
cations between Chicago and New York has a one‐way latency of seven to 
eight milliseconds. This is over a fiber optic network, which (a) transmits 
data through glass (the material that fiber optics are essentially made from), 
and (b) is somewhat circuitous, as there is no telecommunications company 
with a direct route between Chicago and New York. Light travels about 
1.3 times faster through the air than through glass—this explains some 
of the extra latency. The indirect route a conventional fiber optic network 
takes between Chicago and New York explains most of the rest, and the 
small remainder is attributable to suboptimal hardware.
T o solve this problem, a company called Spread Networks undertook 
a fascinating endeavor to make a much more direct path between Chicago 
and New York. They leased and bought tracts of land along this path, and 
found the straightest path possible (cutting through mountains in some 
 
cases). They used the best equipment that money could buy. They 
 
reportedly 
employed 126 four‐person crews to lay a one‐inch‐wide line. Ultimately they 
reduced the distance over which light had to travel by more than 100 miles.
5 
In order to use their service (which immediately sold out), customers had to 
sign multiyear contracts rumored to cost on the order of $10 million. In ex-
change, the one‐way latency between Chicago and New York was reduced 
to about 6.5 milliseconds—1 millisecond faster than the more conventional 
telecommunications solution described earlier .

## Page 276

256  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
But this arms race to zero (as the pursuit of minimum latency is less‐
than‐affectionately known) scarcely ended with Spread Networks’ unveil-
ing. Several firms, including Thesys technologies (a subsidiary of Tradeworx) 
and McKay Brothers, are planning microwave solutions (which bounce mi-
crowave transmissions between towers) in a still‐straighter path between 
Chicago and New York. McKay claims to have a one‐way latency of around 
4.5 milliseconds, and Thesys expects a latency of 4.25 milliseconds. These 
latencies are achievable because microwaves tend to move faster through 
the air than photons move through glass (as with fiber optic cables).
6
There is some light (no pun intended) at the end of the tunnel, how -
ever . The arms race to zero appears to be nearing an end. The potentially 
faster microwave solution may not be as reliable as a closely monitored, 
dedicated fiber optic line, due to weather and other factors. Furthermore, 
the amount of information that can be transmitted via microwave is also 
quite small.
The state of the art connection between London and New York for 
some years was Global Crossing’s AC‐1 transatlantic cable, with one‐way 
transmissions with approximately 65 milliseconds of latency. However , Hi-
bernia Atlantic spent some $300 million laying a transatlantic fiber optic 
cable that allows for one‐way latencies of 59.6 milliseconds. This translates 
into a latency reduction of approximately five milliseconds.
7 The line was 
activated in May 2012, and reportedly was sold out far in advance to a 
handful of trading customers.
b uilding Order b ooks
The data that a given exchange broadcasts to traders is actually in the form 
of messages (new orders, cancellations, and trades), not in the form of an 
order book. It is the job of the quant to build an order book from these 
messages. This turns out to be a very challenging task. In order to have an 
accurate order book at a given point in the day, every message from the 
beginning of the day onward must be processed. There can be no dropped 
messages. Furthermore, this processing has to be very fast; otherwise, la-
tency is introduced. As we all know, there is a trade‐off between speed and 
accuracy that is difficult to overcome. And this is no exception. Worse still, 
there are a number of algorithmic solutions that solve this problem, and 
none are considered industry standard.
A subtler part of this problem (which relates to our next topic) is 
time stamping. Each stream of messages from each exchange has its own 
timestamp. It is crucial to have the sequence of these messages accurately 
recorded as well. So, not only are we processing the messages themselves, 
but the timestamps of each message.

## Page 277

Consolidating Order 
b
ooks
For markets that are fragmented (as in the case of U.S. equities), we have 
multiple streams of messages that need to be aggregated into one consoli-
dated order book. The challenges described above are compounded by the 
task of combining these multiple information sources correctly. For exam-
ple, even if we have an accurate order book for two different exchanges on 
which XYZ is traded, and even if we have the messages correctly ordered 
for each of these two, there can still be problems. The messages from the sec-
ond exchange may be presented to us with greater latency than the first, and 
this must be accounted for when building the consolidated order book. Oth-
erwise, it will appear that things happened in a sequence that is incorrect.
d ata b ursts
One of the most significant (and somewhat unique) challenges facing some-
one building a high‐speed trading infrastructure is the fact that messages do 
not arrive at an even rate throughout the day. This is an extremely sneaky 
problem that bears some discussion.
The pioneers of the mathematics of traffic engineering were involved 
in engineering telephone networks. They assumed that rates of consump-
tion of bandwidth would be basically stationary within some reasonable 
interval, like minutes or seconds. There is a concept in mathematics called 
the Poisson‐distribution (after a French statistician who introduced it in the 
nineteenth century) that is tailor‐made for this application. This assumption 
made sense in engineering phone networks, where average rates could be as-
sumed to be stationary over some intervals. For example, Mother’s Day has 
an incredibly high average call rate, but basically you could assume that call 
arrival rate was constant and calls arrived independently over the busiest 
hour on Mother’s Day.
However , in trading, the very action of one person trading causes an-
other to take action (for example in the placement or cancelation of orders). 
This results in a positive feedback loop, and there is absolutely no stationar-
ity in the message rates inside anything that a normal person would consider 
a reasonable period. T o further elaborate, the average of the message arrival 
rate in the one‐second time frame tells you very little about the arrival rate 
in the one‐millisecond time frame.
Let’s return to the example of EBA Y . Exhibit 14.11 shows the number 
of messages at various percentiles, for various slices of time from one second 
down to 1 millisecond.
What is most interesting about this table is that it shows directly and 
empirically how nonstationary the message rates are. At each percentile, 
you would expect to see one‐tenth the number of messages in one row as 

## Page 278

258  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
in the preceding row. For example, if there are 259 messages per 1 second 
at the 99th percentile, you would expect to see about 26 messages per  
100 milliseconds (because there are 10 separate 100 millisecond periods in 
each second). Instead, we see that there are 13 messages at the 99th per -
centile per 100 milliseconds. By contrast, when we get out to the 99.99th 
percentile, the situation is dramatically different. There are 1,755 messages 
per second in the top 0.01 percent of seconds in the trading day. Thus, you 
might expect to see 176 or so messages per 100 milliseconds at the top 0.01 
percent of millisecond periods during the same trading day. Instead, we see 
863, about five times the expectation.
Comparing 1‐second intervals to 1‐millisecond intervals is even more 
interesting. At the 99.99th percentile, you would expect about 2 messages 
per 1 millisecond, given the number of messages at the 99.99th percentile 
per 1 second (1,755 divided by 1,000—the number of milliseconds in a sin-
gle second—is 1.755). In reality , we find that the number of messages per  
1 
 
millisecond at the 99.99th percentile is 56! Even comparing message rates 
per 10 milliseconds to message rates per 1 millisecond yields surprising results 
(around double the number of messages are transmitted at the 1 millisecond 
level versus what you would expect from looking at the 10 millisecond level.
One could argue that it is silly to worry about the 99.99th percentile. 
Events in this realm happen far less than 1 percent of the time. But consider 
that there are about 23.4 million milliseconds in a 6 ½ hour trading day. 
This means that there are 234,000 observations that occur with 1 percent 
probability during the day. So a system that is designed to capture “only” 
99 percent of all messages transmitted during the day may miss the busiest 
234,000 milliseconds worth of data. This should self‐evidently be a massive 
problem for any algorithmic system. There are 2,340 millisecond intervals 
that constitute the busiest 0.01 percent of observations in a single trading 
day. This is itself a big number . Whereas the tails of the distribution of mes-
sages per 10‐seconds are relatively well‐behaved, the tails of the distribution 
of messages per millisecond are incredibly badly behaved.

Why is this a problem? Because if you are trying to engineer a system to 
be responsive at a given timescale, you need to be able to handle arrival rates 
at around the same timescale. So if you only care about millisecond response 
times, then you can be satisfied with understanding and handling the message 
rates at the one‐millisecond level. But if you care (as many high‐frequency 
traders do) about tenths of a millisecond, you must be able to handle message 
arrival rates at the level of tenths of a millisecond. Here the variability is of 
course even greater . Compounding the problem is the fact that there is a sea-
sonality of busyness within each day . On a typical day , the period just before 
the close is the busiest, and the period just after the open is the second busiest. 
Otherwise things are fairly quiet. This means that on a typical day you have 
to handle outlier amounts of data simultaneously across all tickers. And dur-
ing other busy times (e.g., after a Federal Reserve rate announcement or some 
other big news), the same data‐burst problem reoccurs.
A quant system that is able to handle these problems must deal with po-
tential problems in any number of areas: the connection between the HFT’s 
server and the exchange’s matching engine (known as a cross‐connect), the 
network switch, connections between the colocation facilities of the vari-
ous exchanges, and the data feed handler for each exchange—just to name 
a few. Moreover , bursts of data that might have been handled individually 
could become overwhelming as one aggregates order books from multiple 
exchanges to re-create a real‐time consolidated book.
And if this wasn’t enough of a challenge already, the models used by 
HFTs to process the data and come up with trading signals add latency. It 
takes time to decide exactly what to do. The preferred approach of imple-
menting trading signals is to split them up across multiple servers. But this 
in itself is a further challenge. There are issues with hardware, software, 
and network engineering. How do you distribute consolidated data in a 
timely manner to various servers, for example, when each server is charged 
with computing and running the actual trading strategy? Distributing data 
to various servers adds varying amounts of latency. The better one handles 
these kinds of issues, the less latency introduced during data bursts. The 
worse one handles them, the more latency there is during times of high‐mes-
sage traffic.
Signal Construction
Once data have been properly handled and distributed, a reaction to that 
data needs to be properly constructed and implemented. Broadly speak-
ing, we can define two categories of strategies that can be implemented 
within such a system: execution algorithms (covered in Chapter 7) and an 
HFT strategy. These strategies can be widely varying in the degree of their 

## Page 280

260  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
 complexity. For example, an HFT strategy attempting to control for risk 
factors continuously throughout the day would obviously be more complex 
than an alpha model with an intraday time horizon but no risk manage-
ment. Even alpha models with intraday horizons can vary tremendously 
in their complexity. (We detail the kinds of strategies that HFTs employ in 
the next chapter .) But even if we take two exactly identical HFT strategies, 
there are (in most cases) multiple algorithms that can be used to calculate 
the signals. And not all of these algorithms are equally fast.
T o give an example, index arbitrage is a widely known HFT strategy. 
This strategy involves trading the value of the SPY ETF against the val-
ues of the 500 stocks that constitute it. (Note that index arbitrage can be 
traded on any index versus its constituents, and we use the SPY simply as an 
 
illustrative and well‐known example.) If you know that the S&P 500 index 
consists of 500 stocks and 500 weights, you should be able to compute a 
bottom‐up estimate of the value of the S&P index. If, however , you find that 
the actual value of the SPY ETF , after accounting for expense ratios and 
other similar structural differences between the ETF and a basket of stocks, 
is trading at a different value, then theoretically free money is to be had by 
virtue of buying whichever side is undervalued and selling short whichever 
side is overvalued. As you might imagine, there’s a lot of competition for free 
money. This means that you have to make decisions about what is overval-
ued or undervalued very quickly. As simple as it sounds, comparing the SPY 
ETF to the basket of stocks that compose it at very high speeds is not trivial. 
There are a number of algorithmic solutions for this, and they don’t all do 
the computations equally quickly.
As a sidebar , it is this kind of strategy that you often see in HFT . Very 
simple ideas, very simple calculations, but that require astoundingly fast 
infrastructure to capture. It is therefore very ironic when we hear the press 
talk about “sophisticated, complicated algorithms. ” The difficulty is not in 
understanding what’s being done, but in doing it very quickly.
r isk Checks
The last step before sending an order to the marketplace (in some markets, 
such as U.S. equities) is submitting the order to what’s known as a regula-
tory risk check. Regulators (under the Market Access Rule) have indicated 
that broker‐dealers (who give trading firms access to the marketplace) are 
responsible for ensuring that each trade is (a) within the means of the trader , 
(b) not in error , and (c) compliant with regulatory requirements. They also 
mandate that the risk‐checking software should be in the full and exclu-
sive control of the broker‐dealer whose customer is trying to make a trade. 
This rule was adopted in July 2011 as a response to criticism of HFT and 

## Page 281

High-Speed Trading  261
concerns over the stability of a marketplace without such rules. Elaborating 
a bit further on the kinds of things that need to be checked before an order 
is sent to market:
■■ Does the trader’s buying power allow for the order(s) in question to be 
made?
■■ Does the number of open orders seem to be valid, or does it appear that 
the trader has a bug that leads to an excessive number of open orders?
■■ Does this individual trade seem too large to be intentional?
Prior to the adoption of the Market Access Rule, most broker‐dealers 
operated in accordance with the rule anyway. But a small number of very‐
high‐volume trading firms operated differently. These firms engaged in what 
is called naked access. This meant that customers of the broker‐dealer were 
allowed direct access to the market if the broker was ultimately comfort-
able enough (after performing many checks of its own) with the client’s 
risk‐checking technology. Why does this matter? Because a risk check pro-
vided by the broker generally resides on a broker’s server . For a trade to go 
through a risk check, it must be transmitted by the customer to the broker 
before going out to the market.
This added hop (in network engineering terms) adds more latency for 
two reasons. First, there is another connection between servers that must 
take place (between the customer’s trading server and the broker’s risk‐
checking server). Second, the broker’s risk‐checking software is generally 
going to be inferior to that designed by a speed‐sensitive trader . This could 
be for any number of reasons, including the presence of superior talent at 
the best HFTs or quant trading firms versus the typical brokerage firm, 
or simply different goals. The broker generally cares a lot more about is -
sues like scalability than being hyper‐fast. By contrast, speed‐obsessed HFT 
engineers (who are willing to tackle all the issues above) want the tick‐to‐
trade total latency to be as little as 10 microseconds (0.1 milliseconds). 
They are scarcely going to be satisfied with an added risk‐check latency of 
50 microseconds.
Thus, some HFT firms opted to send their trades directly to the exchange 
after utilizing their own in‐house risk checks. Not many brokers were will-
ing to accept an arrangement like that because the broker ultimately bears 
responsibility if there is a problem with the customer’s risk check. How-
ever , some brokers made a business of providing naked access to HFTs, and 
these firms definitely enjoyed a speed advantage for several years. With the 
Market Access Rule, the SEC banned this practice, and now one must use a 
broker‐dealer’s risk check. This drove some of the largest HFTs to build out 
their own broker‐dealer units so that they could continue to use their own

risk checks with additional regulatory overhead. It also drove a new arms 
race to create the fastest commercial risk checks. As of today’s writing, there 
are roughly three top‐tier solutions; the others lag well behind. Solving the 
risk check problem remains an area where some HFTs (and, primarily, their 
service providers) focus on reducing latency.
Su MMA ry
In this chapter , we have elaborated on the reasons that high speed (or low 
latency) trading matters, as well as the sources of latency. Depending on 
the type of trade or trading strategy being implemented, there are differing 
reasons for the emphasis on speed. And, while this has received a significant 
amount of negative attention in the press, it is absolutely no different from 
the situation in any other industry. If an advantage can be developed within 
the rules of a competitive game, then the most competitive players will seek 
to develop that edge. But, as is the case for quant trading in general, there 
is clearly a double standard when it comes to HFT and low-latency trading. 
People seem to be really angry that HFTs, having solved the incredibly diffi-
cult problems enumerated above, have achieved a (completely legal, ethical, 
and fair) competitive advantage over other traders.
The irony, as we will discuss further in Chapter 16, is that low‐latency 
trading is like any other enterprise in a reasonably free‐enterprise system: 
Taking risk does not imply that one will succeed. Countless HFTs have 
invested enormous sums of time and money into infrastructure, only to 
find that they lack the ability simply to generate acceptable returns. Many 
more HFTs either cannot afford the huge investment of resources, or sim -
ply lack the expertise, to create their own infrastructure. A typical build 
versus buy  decision is made, and some firms end up utilizing commercial 
vendors for many or all parts of this infrastructure. Some firms advertise 
themselves as “HFT‐in‐a‐Box” solutions, which allow a strategist with a 
good idea to implement her strategy without having to build all of these 
other elements. Unfortunately, few of these vendors deliver what is ad -
vertised (just as is true in basically any industry). The result is that when 
the opportunities to add value are the most plentiful (when trading activ -
ity is at its most frenzied level), relatively few vendors are able to deliver 
true low-latency solutions. To quote Mike Beller , CTO of Tradeworx, who 
helped me with this chapter: “Be suspicious of anyone who quotes aver -
ages, or even averages and standard deviations. Responsible people engi -
neer for the 99th percentile. ”
Even firms that have the resources and that have been successful are 
subject to substantial risks. While detractors of HFT have pointed to the 

## Page 283

near‐death experience of Knight Capital in 2012 as evidence that HFTs 
cause instability in the markets, the reality is extremely different: Knight 
made a change to its software that introduced a bug. It was a mistake of its 
own doing. And who suffered? Knight. It nearly went out of business and 
had to secure emergency funding to stay afloat, at the expense of a large 
portion of the value of its business. While it’s sad for Knight and those who 
own their stock, it is exactly fair . Knight made a mistake, and Knight paid 
the price. No mom and pop investors, no pensioners, no market systems 
were harmed. And all of this is in pursuit of what amounts to a $0.001 per 
share profit expectation.
This point is perhaps the most important to remember . A tenth of a 
penny per share is the expected profit margin of a successful U.S. equity 
high‐frequency trader . In exchange for this, these traders take on the risks 
associated with the capital and time expenditures of competing in a hyper -
competitive space. For traders who are expecting to hold positions for a 
year and make 25 percent or more on that trade, HFTs add liquidity. That 
they might make $0.001 per share to provide that liquidity is both inconse-
quential and totally fair . We now turn to the kinds of strategies that HFTs 
employ.

In case you were wondering why the ES futures tend to lead SPY ETFs, the rea-
son is primarily that the ES futures are where the largest dollar volumes exist. 
This is probably for two reasons. The first is that ES futures have been around 
a lot longer than SPY ETFs, so some of this is just incumbency, both because of 
habit (once an instrument becomes the instrument of choice for a given expo-
sure, it tends to retain that title with a large amount of inertia on its side), and 
because it is a pain in the neck to change one’s infrastructure to trade stocks 
(ETFs are listed and traded the same way as stocks, for all intents and purposes) 
when one is already trading futures. Second, the futures markets do offer a 
couple of structural advantages over ETFs. Profits on many futures contracts 
are subject to less onerous taxes than profits on equity or ETF trades. Also, fu-
tures contracts offer a fairly substantial amount of leverage, so whether a trader 
wants to make a big bet or simply doesn’t want to spend a lot of money to put 
on that bet, futures can be an efficient way to implement the trade. However , the 
gap has been narrowing somewhat, driven by the migration of retail investors 
away from actively managed mutual funds into passive ETFs, and partially by 
virtue of the fact that, in many ways, the ETFs are often cheaper (in aggregate) 
to transact.

If you have a mouse in your hand, you are too late!
—Blair Hull, December 2000
W
e have described the importance of, components of, and challenges 
to building a high-speed (low-latency) trading infrastructure. These 
components are used, primarily, for either high‐frequency trading (HFT) 
applications or for implementing automated execution algorithms. In this 
chapter , we will focus on HFT , seeking to understand the kinds of strategies 
employed by these traders and how these techniques relate to the infrastruc-
ture we have outlined.
There is no widely accepted classification of HFT strategies. However , 
we can consider them to fall into one of four broad categories: contractual 
market making, noncontractual market making, arbitrage, and fast alpha. 
In this chapter , we will describe each of these kinds of strategies, as well as 
the risk management and portfolio construction considerations that apply 
to them.
Contra C tual Market Making
A contractual market maker (CMM) is the class of HFT practitioner that 
has the closest analog to a traditional feature of the markets. First, we should 
understand the concept of market making.
The odds that two customers simultaneously want to do exactly oppo-
site things (e.g., customer A wants to buy 2,000 shares of XYZ at $100.00, 
while customer B wants to sell 2,000 shares of XYZ at $100.00) are fairly 
small. Of course, it is reasonably likely that there is at least some portion of a 
customer’s desired trade that could be filled by another customer . Taking our 
Chapter 15
h igh-Frequency t rading

## Page 286

266  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
example above, maybe customer A wants to buy 2,000 shares, while cus-
tomer B wants to sell 5,000 shares. The balance—a desired sale of 3,000 
shares—either goes unfilled until a later time (usually at a time adverse to 
the seller), or it can be filled by an intermediary who is willing to take the 
risk of buying 3,000 shares for the sole reason that customer B wants to sell 
them. Market makers are precisely this kind of intermediary: They provide 
liquidity to those who have a utility for it.
An analogy from daily life is useful here. Manufacturers rarely sell their 
goods directly to retail customers because, practically speaking, they have 
operations lifecycles to manage. They cannot afford to change how much 
and what they are supplying at the whims of retail customers. Thus, distrib-
utors buy goods from manufacturers and warehouse those goods until the 
retail market is ready for them. In the same way, market participants don’t 
necessarily make investment decisions that coincide perfectly, and market 
makers get paid to warehouse the risk in the interim.
There are two types of market makers. In this section, we will describe 
CMMs, who are sometimes referred to as order flow internalizers. The first 
key to understanding CMMs is to look at the economic and contractual 
relationships that CMMs have with the market. The CMM’s obligations 
vary by market, instrument, and geography, but we can examine U.S. equity 
market making as one example. CMMs engage in legal relationships with 
various brokerage firms (whose clients wish to make trades), so that the 
brokerage routes its customers’ orders to the market maker to be executed. 
In exchange for the broker sending its retail order flow to the CMM, the 
CMM often is required to: (a) pay the broker
1 and (b) fill 100 percent of the 
orders that customers send to it. Generally, this last obligation has two dif-
ferent types of commitments to fill: one in the case of small orders and one 
in the case of large orders.
CMMs in U.S. equities generally are required to fill 100 percent of 
“small” orders on an automated basis (this is aptly known as autofill). So, 
for example, a typical investor in U.S. equities has an account with some on-
line broker . This investor decides to buy, say, 200 shares of XYZ as a market 
order . The CMM has agreed with the broker that it will sell 200 shares of 
XYZ to this customer at whatever the prevailing market’s best offer is. But 
interestingly, neither the customer’s order to buy nor the CMM’s taking the 
other side of that trade ever goes into the exchange’s limit order book. The 
transaction happens away from the exchanges, but it references the activity 
that is taking place on the exchanges (specifically, the best bid or offer).
The CMM, by virtue of having agreed to this contractual relationship 
with the broker , gains an advantage that supersedes even the fastest traders. 
In effect, it doesn’t even need to post bids and offers because it passively 
takes the other side of all customer order flow as it comes in. This happens 

## Page 287

High-Frequency Trading  267
in the reverse sequence to what happens in a normal market  situation: 
 
Generally a passive order is resting in the limit order book, and an active 
order comes into the market later and takes the liquidity offered by the 
passive order . In this case, the active order to buy comes to the CMM, and 
the CMM uses the prevailing best offer from the exchanges to fill the active 
order . While the CMM’s orders are not actually in the queue, there is always 
at least some support behind their positions. After all, the CMM is pig-
gybacking on whatever the prevailing best offer was at the time the CMM 
elected to fill the customer order . All that said, so far , it is not at all obvious 
that the customer is any worse off by virtue of his broker having established 
this contractual relationship. The customer’s order is filled at the prevailing 
best price available and does not need to compete with other active orders.
We contended in Chapter 14 that trading passively is not necessarily 
a highly profitable activity (especially before the incentives provided by 
some exchanges for providing liquidity), because of the problem of adverse 
 
selection. However , when facing off against retail order flow, a passive par-
ticipant enjoys the most favorable selection possible. Retail order flow gen-
erally consists of a large number of small orders, and the aggregate of these 
orders on a given name is usually a fairly small net quantity. This means that 
there is unlikely to be any significant price impact, which is another impor-
tant determinant of the level of adverse selection.
For larger orders, CMMs generally have the right to act as an agent 
of the customer , trying to get the order filled at market, without taking the 
whole order for itself. So, if the customer wants to buy 10,000 shares of 
XYZ, the market maker acts on behalf of the customer in attempting to get 
the order filled. However , here, a perverse incentive may exist. At the very 
least, it is quite an interesting situation. Let’s start with an illustrative order 
book for XYZ, immediately before the customer’s 10,000 share buy order 
comes in, shown in Exhibit 15.1.
If we imagine the 10,000 share buy order comes in at this moment, the 
CMM can go to market, lift all 2,000 shares offered at $100.01 (Offer1)

and all 4,000 shares at $100.02 (the sum of Offer2 and Offer3). He has 
now filled 6,000 shares at an average price of $100.0167. Then he can take, 
say, 3,500 shares of the 4,000 offered at $100.03 (Offer4), and fill the last 
500 shares himself. Now that the prevailing best offer is $100.03, he will fill 
them at $100.03. The order book immediately after this order is filled looks 
as shown in Exhibit 15.2.
Those first 9,500 shares offered had no idea that the price was about 
to move up by 2–3 cents immediately. So in this case, since the CMM knew 
that this customer’s order was about to push the price up, he delayed selling 
until the buy order was almost exhausted. Those last 500 shares, however , 
are likely to have been profitable to sell. If there was no other buying pres-
sure behind that 10,000 share buy order , the upward move is likely to be 
immediately reversed, and the offered side of the book is likely to replenish 
with offers that are lower priced than $100.03. This will allow the CMM to 
exit his position at a profit, and at the expense of those traders whose orders 
were at lower‐priced offers initially.
I mentioned that this is, at the very least, an interesting dynamic. It 
may incentivize the CMM to act in a way that is adverse to the customer , 
however . If the CMM has the ability to act as an agent of the customer and 
to fill the last portion of a trade, the CMM has an incentive to do the worst 
possible job of filling the bulk of the customer’s order , because it pushes the 
price to a level that almost certainly makes taking the other side of it very at-
tractive. In other words, the CMM could use a horribly ineffective execution 
strategy for the first 9,500 shares, specifically designed to get the customer 
the worst possible price (especially on the last few hundred shares), so that 
the CMM can come in and take those last few hundred shares into his own 
inventory at an untenably high price.
Exchanges have begun to fight back against internalization of order 
flow. Interestingly, the near‐destruction of Knight Capital in August 2012

was an indirect result of the NYSE’s introduction of a new program de-
signed specifically to combat order flow internalization. This program, 
called the Retail Liquidity Program (RLP), offers retail orders access to bet-
ter fill prices than they historically could get. T o deal with this change in the 
market structure, Knight made some changes to its own software. And due 
to a bug in that new release, Knight’s brush with bankruptcy unfolded in 
merely a half hour . It is not a coincidence that the roughly 140 stocks that 
Knight lost money on were all NYSE tickers. That said, programs such as 
the RLP are not intended to put CMMs out of business. Indeed, thus far the 
biggest participants in such programs are the CMMs themselves. The idea is 
simply to get as much share volume on the lit venues as possible.
As we relate the activities of CMMs to what we showed in Chapter 14 
about high-speed trading and the various types of orders, we can see clearly 
why CMMs need to be fast. While they do not need to compete with other 
participants for better queue placement in order to get into a position (this 
comes to them from the brokerage firms directly), they do need to (a) have 
a precise, timely estimate of the market in order to fill orders at the correct 
price; and (b) be able to exit positions rapidly. They, after all, are taking on 
the other side of others’ trades. And while retail orders may not be the worst 
kind to take the other side of, there is still a real risk that retail participants 
will move heavily in one direction on a given instrument (for example, if 
a stock has good news, many customers are likely to want to buy it). This 
can result in the market maker taking on a significant amount of size on the 
wrong side of the news and short‐term momentum in such an instrument, 
which highlights the need for speed in placing orders to reduce the inven-
tory acquired. All that said, a CMM’s need for speed is categorically not at 
the same level as it is among the HFTs we will describe in the subsequent 
sections of this chapter .
n on C ontra C tual Market Making
Noncontractual market making (NCMM) also involves taking the other 
side of active orders. NCMMs provide bids and offers that rest in the or -
der books of various exchanges, particularly lit exchanges (as described in 
“Where to Send an Order”). In many markets, they are incentivized to pro-
vide liquidity by virtue of liquidity provision rebates. In other markets, ac-
tive order flow is sufficiently benign that a fast NCMM can still turn a profit 
even without any further compensation. In general, an NCMM acquires 
positions by placing passive orders, waiting for someone to lift his bid or 
offer . Once acquired, the NCMM may exit passively or actively, depending 
on liquidity provision rebates and the market’s movements.

## Page 290

270  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
Given their reliance on passive orders, the biggest risk that any market 
maker is exposed to is adverse selection. A market maker taking the other 
side of one order can hope he is able to take the other side of another order 
immediately, and at a profit that at least equals the bid/offer spread. Or , if 
the market moves his way, he may be able to exit actively, and make money 
on the move. This is the embodiment of “buy low, sell high,” but modi-
fied: “buy low, sell ever‐so‐slightly higher , very soon, and repeatedly. ” And 
indeed, in normal times, in the absence of a very short‐term trend, this is at 
least somewhat achievable.
But first, there is the matter of being fast enough to avoid the adverse 
selection problems that plague any passive order in the lit markets. As we 
showed in Chapter 14, this is no small feat in the first place. When we look 
at the kinds of trades that NCMMs in U.S. equities take the other side 
of, for example, we find that most of the best order flow is internalized, 
either by CMMs or by dark pools. This leaves NCMMs to interact prima-
rily with professional investors in the lit exchanges, against whose orders 
it is 
 
dangerous to trade. Thus, while speed matters to any market maker , 
 
NCMMs have a particularly acute need to be fast. As an aside, NCMMs do 
usually have access to dark exchanges as well, and often will route orders 
through these dark pools first, taking advantage of superior liquidity taking 
fees, before sending the remainder out to the lit exchanges.
Second, NCMMs must have fast access to information sets that can 
help them avoid adverse selection problems. We showed in Chapter 14 that 
the ability to cancel passive orders quickly is critical to a passive trader’s 
likelihood of success. For example, if some stock index’s futures contract 
is rallying sharply, there is a very strong probability that a wide variety of 
stocks will also rally sharply in the immediate future. A NCMM who cannot 
access information about the futures market in a timely manner will likely 
end up failing to cancel his passive offers at the top of the order book, which 
will cause him to experience adverse selection in the fills he receives on his 
sell‐trades.
A key challenge for NCMMs is how to manage and dispose of the in -
ventory they acquire by virtue of having other market participants lift their 
bids and offers. This can be particularly challenging when markets are trend-
ing, leaving the NCMM with large positions in the opposite direction of 
the trend. As mentioned earlier , NCMMs bear such substantial risks when 
holding positions that they sometimes actively exit their trades, even though 
this means crossing the bid‐offer spread and possibly also paying a liquidity 
taking fee. Another approach to dealing with inventory risk is to take oppos-
ing positions in instruments that closely correlate with those in inventory . For 
example, if UVW is an imaginary company that is a peer of XYZ, in the same 
industry group, with a similar market capitalization (and so on), it is highly 

## Page 291

High-Frequency Trading  271
likely that any large, directional move in XYZ will be mirrored in UVW . 
Thus, if the market maker is filled on a passive bid in XYZ (which makes 
him long XYZ), his algorithms can consider putting passive offers on UVW , 
or actively selling it, to hedge his risk that XYZ experiences a large move.
a rbitrage
The word arbitrage connotes riskless profit. This has obvious appeal, and 
it is equally obvious that risk‐free profits are hard to come by. Arbitrage 
opportunities exist when instruments that are structurally correlated be-
have differently. We define structural correlation as a correlation that exists 
because it must. Instruments that track the S&P 500 index, for example, 
should all correlate roughly perfectly. If the S&P 500 futures contract (ES) is 
up 1 percent for today, while the SPY ETF (which tracks the S&P 500 also) 
is up only 0.6 percent, a riskless profit opportunity exists, to go short the 
futures and go long the ETF . In this way, the trader has virtually guaranteed 
himself a 0.4 percent profit. These two instruments are both meant to track 
the performance of the same 500 stocks, and when one is outperforming the 
other , it is necessarily because there are temporary imbalances in the trad-
ing of one versus the other . For example, if a large order to buy the futures 
suddenly hits the market, moving the futures contract up suddenly, it might 
take a small amount of time for the passive orders (both bids and offers) in 
the ETF to cancel and ratchet upward. During that time, a sufficiently fast 
arbitrageur can pick off a slow‐to‐cancel passive order and acquire a riskless 
profit position.
In order to qualify as a true arbitrage, a trade must capture an inefficien-
cy in the marketplace that causes the price of an instrument (or derived ver-
sion of the instrument) to be different in different locations (e.g., exchanges) 
or formats (e.g., an ETF versus the stocks that constitute that same ETF) at 
precisely the same moment. The arbitrageur sells the relatively overpriced 
one and buys the relatively underpriced one, so that when they converge, he 
reaps the profit.
The most common form of HFT arbitrage is index arbitrage, which is 
the broader label for our earlier example of S&P futures versus the SPY ETF . 
This is a strategy that compares the value of an instrument that tracks an in-
dex either to another instrument that tracks the same index, or to the value 
of the constituents of the same index. Take an imaginary futures contract 
that tracks an index that contains two instruments at a 50/50 weighting. 
The index can be priced either directly in the futures contract or indirectly 
by taking the value of each of the constituents and multiplying that value 
by the weight (50 percent each, in our example). Because the index trades 

## Page 292

272  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
separately from its constituents (often on different exchanges), the prices of 
the index traded as a whole versus index that can be created synthetically by 
buying its constituents in the correct weighting can and do diverge by small 
amounts and for short amounts of time.
Another type of arbitrage is venue arbitrage, which exists only in frag-
mented markets. A venue arbitrage takes advantage of a fragmented market 
structure (which means that there are multiple exchanges that allow trading 
on the same instrument), which can sometimes cause a price to be different 
on one venue from what it is on another . Here, the instrument isn’t merely 
structurally correlated to another instrument; it is actually the exact same 
instrument traded in more than one place. For the same reason that index 
arbitrage opportunities can come to exist, these venue arbitrage opportuni-
ties also can exist. In U.S. equities, Reg NMS was enacted in 2007 in an 
attempt to deal with this problem. In certain other markets, venue arbitrage 
remains a possibility.
In a sense, when a CMM receives customer orders that include requests 
to buy and sell the same instrument at the same time, she has an arbitrage 
opportunity, because she can sell the instrument to one party and buy it 
from another at the same time, at different (advantageous) prices. The buy 
order is filled at the prevailing best offer , and the sell order is filled at the 
prevailing best bid (which, by definition, is lower than the offer). T o address 
this extremely obvious inequity, some brokers have begun to require CMMs 
to fill both such customer orders at the best mid‐price when there are match-
ing and opposed orders.
While risk‐free profits are undeniably attractive, the cost of remaining 
at the highest tier of the technological capabilities required to be fast enough 
to capture such opportunities is substantial. At first glance, it is evident that 
speed should matter , for the same reason that $100 bills don’t get left on the 
street for very long. If you can cross the bid‐offer spread and realize an arbi-
trage opportunity, then it makes sense to do so. But occasionally, depending 
on the size of the opportunity, passive orders can be used to improve returns. 
If the price discrepancy is very large, and if the exchange(s) involved provide 
liquidity provision rebates, it may be an added benefit to implement an ar -
bitrage trade using limit orders. But in general, these are active trades. It is 
better to capture some riskless profit with 100 percent certainty than to risk 
missing the whole opportunity by trying to make it marginally better .
As a practical matter , not all HFT arbitrages are strictly riskless. In more 
efficient markets (e.g., U.S. equity indices and single stocks), it is often impos-
sible to do both legs of the arbitrage trade. The opportunity is so fleeting that 
only one leg at a time can be implemented. So, for example, a strategy that 
compares ETFs to futures might be able to trade the ETFs only , betting on 
a lead‐lag relationship between the instruments. But the futures might well 

## Page 293

High-Frequency Trading  273
move again before the trader can lock in a profit. This is still a good trading 
strategy , but on a given trade, its odds are not substantially better than even. 
In less efficient markets, there remain opportunities for truly riskless profit.
Fast a lpha
The fourth type of HFT strategy we will consider is fast alpha. Fast alpha 
strategies are in essence engaged in the same kinds of strategies as discussed 
in Chapter 3. They mainly use price‐based signals, such as momentum, mean 
reversion, and technical sentiment. If we consider what we described in 
Chapter 8, regarding the influence of data types on the kinds of strategies 
that can be implemented using such data, it makes sense that this should 
be the case. Fundamental information does not change very often. When it 
does, it usually takes some time (more than a day in most cases) to be fully 
priced‐in. Furthermore, most fundamental information is released during af-
ter‐hours or pretrading sessions, when liquidity is poor . However , important 
(i.e., surprising) fundamental data do have an impact on prices on a very 
short (intraday) timescale. In 24‐hour markets such as currencies, this can be 
even more true, though there are natural increases in liquidity during certain 
more conventional market hours. In any case, various growth or value types 
of strategies can be implemented on an intraday timescale, but this is in the 
tiny minority of cases. Mostly , fast alpha strategies act on information that 
changes frequently throughout the trading day: prices, volumes, and limit 
order book information. Because changes in fundamentals can result in high 
volumes, HFTs can be quite active when these changes occur , even if they are 
not explicitly trying to trade based on the fundamental information itself.
Contrasting fast alpha strategies with arbitrage strategies is also useful. 
Whereas arbitrage strategies are taking advantage of price discrepancies be-
tween instruments that are structurally correlated, fast alpha strategies are 
sometimes looking to profit from price discrepancies on a statistical basis. 
For example, if XYZ and UVW are two companies in the same industry 
group that are close peers, with similar market capitalizations and funda -
mental features, one would expect them to track each other most of the 
time. If XYZ diverges from UVW , you can reasonably expect that it should 
converge. But what if the divergence stems from some real information that 
implies the beginning of a decoupling between XYZ and UVW? Just as we 
showed in the example of MER and SCHW in Chapter 10, instruments can 
go through periods of being closely correlated, and periods of being com -
pletely different. In other words, there is no structural reason that correlation 
between the two instruments must remain related. And as a result, we are 
dealing with a statistical relationship, which by definition implies some risk.

## Page 294

274  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
This is also true for directional types of forecasts, which look at histori-
cal behavior as a guideline for future behavior . There may, for example, be a 
good chance that, if some instrument makes consecutive new intraday highs 
several seconds in a row, it will decline briefly thereafter . But this is still a 
matter of chance. There is no structural relationship between the past per -
formance of the instrument and the future performance of the instrument 
that causes this setup to remain a return generating strategy.
Some fast alpha strategies are more passive, for example, intraday ver -
sions of statistical arbitrage. They can be considered as close cousins of 
 
NCMMs, in the sense that they are passively placing orders that provide li-
quidity, but perhaps with a certain selectivity that (hopefully) reduces adverse 
selection issues. For such strategies, everything we discussed in 
 
Chapter 14 
regarding the need for speed in placing and canceling passive orders ap-
plies. Intraday momentum strategies can also be implemented passively, by 
canceling passive orders that would take the other side of the prevailing 
trend and working orders that would get the strategy into a position in the 
direction of the trend. Obviously, these orders are less likely to be executed, 
because they are attempting to capture small pullbacks in a trend. Further -
more, adverse selection issues apply, particularly when the trend reverses. As 
such, the need for speed here stems from a desire to get passive orders to the 
top of the book, and from the need to cancel stale passive orders to avoid 
adverse selection issues.
More often, intraday trend following is an actively implemented strat-
egy. These strategies have a particularly difficult challenge because market 
impact and slippage are both working severely against the strategy’s objec-
tives. If an instrument is trending down on a very short timescale, a fast 
trend-following strategy will naturally want to get short that instrument (or 
instruments that closely correlate to it). However , any delay in processing 
data or getting orders back to the marketplace can be detrimental, because 
the market will not wait for a slow trader to figure out what to do. The 
trend can move the instrument away from the slow trader , resulting in large 
slippage costs. Furthermore, because the trader is desiring to buy (or sell) 
an instrument that has already been going up (or down) for some time, 
market impact costs are also likely to be more severe in this case. For these 
 
reasons, intraday trend following is less common than mean reversion ori-
ented 
 
trading strategies, and requires low latency capabilities.
h F t  r isk Manage M ent and p ort F olio Constru C tion
HFT strategies most often have a different approach to risk management 
from their slower peers, even for strategies (such as those in the fast alpha 

## Page 295

category) that share similar underlying themes. Accounting for risk factors, 
transaction cost models, and various other inputs to an optimizer , for ex-
ample, takes precious computing time. This would slow down the process 
of implementing the alpha strategy. Furthermore, most of the kinds of risk 
factors that longer‐term strategies would want to hedge rarely apply to secu-
rity movements from one moment to the next intraday. For example, some 
longer‐term traders care about neutralizing their exposure to the size factor 
(market capitalization, essentially). They don’t want to have a bias of being 
long small capitalization companies and short large caps (or vice versa). 
Intraday, this is a dramatically less useful distinction, because the way that 
this risk factor expresses itself in the markets simply doesn’t take place at an 
(often very short‐term) intraday timescale. Another way of thinking of this 
effect is that statistical correlations are much weaker at shorter timescales 
than at longer ones, while idiosyncratic (primarily liquidity‐driven) consid-
erations are more significant.
There is a further question of applicability of risk models to three 
of the four types of HFT strategies described above. Arbitrage strategies, 
for example, clearly require a different type of risk management from 
what is provided by a risk factor model. By design, long positions and 
short positions are in essentially identical instruments. This leaves no 
room for conventional risk factor exposures. The kinds of considera -
tions that apply to arbitrageurs relate to sizing their bets to ensure that 
the temporary variances in the spread between their longs and shorts do 
not put them out of business. For CMMs and NCMMs, the goal is to 
unload inventory as quickly as possible, not to worry about risk factor 
exposures.
The most common approach to risk management for HFT strategies 
is to control a very small number of very simple‐to‐calculate risks. For 
example, limiting the maximum order size on a given ticker, the maxi -
mum accumulated position size for a given instrument, the maximum 
aggregate portfolio size, or the maximum number of open orders on an 
instrument (or in aggregate) are all very simple risk checks that add vir -
tually no latency. Many will automatically unwind their portfolios and 
stop trading if they reach a certain predefined loss level. Some HFTs will 
elect to control their directional exposure as well, limiting their net long 
or short percentages. Most HFT strategies are concerned with ensur -
ing that hedging trades are put on extremely quickly, and before prices 
move adversely. For example, if an arbitrage trader sees an opportunity 
to buy the S&P 500 index and short the underlying stocks, locking in 
some small profit, it is possible that both legs of this trade will not be 
implemented at precisely the same moment. After one leg is executed, the 
trader simply owns a directional bet on the stock market. It is not until 

## Page 296

276  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
the second leg is executed that the trade becomes an arbitrage (and risk 
free). As such, if the market moves adversely to the first leg of the trade 
before the second leg can be put on, not only might the opportunity dis -
appear, but money can easily be lost. This is known as legging risk , and 
many HFTs try to manage it.
Portfolio construction, too, looks very different for HFTs from what it 
is for longer‐term quants. The most obvious example of this is in the case 
of arbitrage trades. If you have an opportunity to make riskless profits, you 
should do that trade as large as the market will allow you to do. For both 
kinds of market makers, they have little control over how many of their 
passive orders end up being lifted by more active participants. For them, it 
comes down to simply ensuring that they diversify their risk across names, 
or to limiting the maximum size of inventory that can be accumulated (since 
whatever is accumulated must soon thereafter be dispensed). In the case of 
fast alpha strategies, there is no particularly common theme to how trad-
ers size positions. But they tend to use the simpler ideas from among those 
discussed in Chapter 6. Equal weighting positions, or weighting them based 
simply on the expected return, are common approaches. But considerations 
of covariance and volatility rarely factor in, and there is almost no sense in 
running an optimization or even accounting for risk and transaction cost 
modeling. All of these things add time to the process of making trades, and 
so simplifying the calculation of the strategy (as we discussed in Chapter 14) 
is an important way to reduce latency.
The most surprising thing about HFTs is that, while they trade (hyper)
actively, they most often do not account for transaction cost models in their 
strategies. This seems paradoxical: If transaction cost models are supposed 
to help you trade in a smarter way, why would the very active traders eschew 
them? In some sense, the transaction costs that other investors are paying 
(bid/offer spreads and liquidity taking fees) are often the main sources of 
alpha for many HFTs. As such, transaction costs as typically defined are very 
often negative: They are sources of profit. Obviously, it then becomes desir-
ous to trade as often as possible. This is outside of a passive HFT’s control, 
because she cannot cause someone else to trade actively, but it is an objective 
for a passive HFT nonetheless.
Active HFT strategies, by contrast, must overcome the same transaction 
costs as apply to other investors, but without the benefit of holding the posi-
tion for a very long time. As you can imagine, not nearly as many opportuni-
ties exist to hold a position for a short amount of time, say a few minutes, 
and generate a profit net of transaction costs. HFTs, thus, tend to consider 
commissions, regulatory fees, and taxes, and the economics of providing or 
taking liquidity more than market impact and slippage.

We have now explored the kinds of strategies that HFTs utilize. You may 
notice that there are some significant differences between HFT strategies 
and the kinds of alpha strategies that we described in Chapter 3. Indeed, 
many HFT practitioners, privately, will tell you they don’t think about alpha 
at all. Even for those that do, it is most often at best secondary to technol-
ogy concerns. A major risk is losing a speed advantage. And, when you look 
at both the kinds of strategies being employed and the penalties that accrue 
to being slow (which we described in Chapter 14), it begins to be clear why 
this is the case.
It does not take someone particularly clever to say that the S&P 500 
index should have basically the same value in every instrument that tracks 
it. This is a tautology, in fact. S&P 500 = S&P 500. But it is something else 
entirely to be able to profit from the extremely fleeting instances where there 
is a divergence. It is specifically a technological problem, and many of the 
strategies that HFTs employ are at least as much driven by technology as by 
a better way of forecasting the future.

 1.  This practice is called payment for order flow. It carries quite a bit of contro-
versy, because the beneficiary of the payment for order flow is generally the bro-
ker , not the broker’s customers. It is, of course, the customers who send orders. 
As a result of the well‐deserved controversy around this practice, it has become 
less common as the years have gone by. But it has been a feature of the capital 
markets for much longer than HFTs have existed.

s we described at the beginning of Part Four , HFT came into the public’s 
consciousness through controversies surrounding it. Most of the argu-
ments against HFT strike me as being arguments made by people who are 
either ignorant of the facts or motivated by self‐interest to present biased 
and flawed information to the public. The kinds of criticisms generally ig-
nore the differences between the various types of HFTs, confuse various ele-
ments of market structure with the practice of HFT , and conflate high-speed 
trading (and, often, quant trading in general) with HFT .
The criticisms of HFT seem to gravitate around four major ideas. Ac-
cording to detractors, HFT:
	 1.	 Represents unfair competition, creating a two‐tiered system of haves 
and have‐nots.
	 2.	 Manipulates markets and/or engages in front‐running other investors.
	 3.	 Causes structural instability and/or creates additional volatility in 
 markets.
	 4.	 Has no social value.
We will address each of these arguments in order , with the primary goal 
of separating fact from fiction.

Does h F t  Create Un F air Competition?
In 2009, Andrew Brooks, head of U.S. equity trading for T . Rowe Price, said, 
“But we’re moving toward a two‐tiered marketplace of the high‐frequency 
arbitrage guys, and everyone else. People want to know they have a legiti-
mate shot at getting a fair deal. Otherwise, the markets lose their integrity. ”
1 
The idea behind this argument is that superfast computers, algorithms, and 
telecomm setups are all very expensive and unavailable to the average per -
son, and they create a two‐tiered system where HFTs have a huge advan-
tage. This is not an accurate assessment of the current state of the markets. 
There are three reasons why, and we will go through each of them here.
t he r ole of s peed in m arket m aking
Markets need market makers, just as manufacturers and consumers need 
distributors. There have always been market makers, and you can’t have 
a properly functioning market without them. Furthermore, market mak -
ers have always had to be fast, because of the adverse selection problem 
associated with passive trading, which we covered in Chapter 14. In the 
past, speed advantages were obtained by a privileged tier of traders who 
were allowed to be insiders of the exchange. They used to be called lo -
cals, floor traders, specialists, and so on. Now, speed advantages are earned 
competitively on a level playing field, and this represents serious progress 
in leveling the playing field dramatically compared to the state of markets 
in years gone by.
The markets are more egalitarian today than they ever have been in 
their history. We have already given the examples from the early 1800s, 
when a carrier pigeon was winning technology, providing those that in -
vested in it a serious speed advantage. In the early days of Wall Street, firms 
who were more proximate to the physical exchange had superior speed and 
access advantages. Later , those that had telephones before others had an 
advantage. And so on. The advantage that a big bank had over the average 
investor was bigger by orders of magnitude in 1929 than in 2009. In 2009, 
the advantage of Getco, among the very fastest in the HFT world, over 
the average online brokerage customer was on the order of a fraction of a 
second. Even on a very busy day, the advantage gained by such an edge in 
speed is trivially small. Compare that with the advantage of a firm that had 
personnel on the exchange floor 30 years ago, trading in real time, while a 
typical retail investor would check end‐of‐day prices the next morning in 
the newspaper!
When advantages are gained in a fair game, on a level playing field, 
this is not an unfair competition issue, nor is it a two‐tiered system  

## Page 301

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  281
issue. It is a competitive  advantage. Brooks’ comments can be taken to 
mean that people who are smarter , and who invest capital in expensive 
infrastructure that makes them better able to compete, have an unfair 
advantage over everyone else. But by that standard, Warren Buffett has 
an unfair advantage over everyone else by being earlier to the table on 
a good idea. He has extra access to information, he is smarter , and he 
has analysts who do a better job than others are able to do of process -
ing information. Why wouldn’t that reduce the integrity of the markets? 
This analogy extends to all fields where competition is present. The New 
York Yankees can afford to pay any player any amount they want to in 
order to acquire his services, thereby building a more talented team than 
many others. Not all players choose to play for them, and the Yankees are 
clearly not assured of success by virtue of having the highest payroll in 
their sport. Formula One racing teams are not all equal in funding or tal -
ent. Some have better drivers and engineers, they engage in better R&D, 
and they end up winning more races as a result. The reality is that none 
of this is unfair . It is basic capitalism: If you are willing to take a risk, you 
might get a reward.
It would be unfair if some players were being prevented from taking 
risks and having a chance at rewards. But this is clearly not the case with 
HFT . Anyone can get colocation space for servers. Anyone can get top‐of‐
the‐line hardware and fast communications networks. There was an incident 
in 2012, in which the NYSE was justly punished for making certain datasets 
available only to some HFTs. But the point is that NYSE was in violation 
of extant rules (Rule 603(a) of Reg NMS, specifically), which make it clear 
that anyone who wants this special data can get it. They were fined, and the 
issue has been put to bed.
2 It is clear that firms that wish to compete must 
invest a lot of capital in infrastructure. They also have to acquire the skills 
to compete. But that’s true for almost any venture.
Moreover , investment in massively expensive infrastructure does not 
guarantee success. I won’t name names, but I know many HFTs that have 
sunk millions of their own and investors’ money into infrastructure and 
have absolutely nothing to show for it except red ink. This demonstrates 
that paying for the kind of speed we discussed in Chapter 14 does not 
 
guarantee profits. It merely puts a trader on a level playing field with other 
traders attempting to do similar things. And, as is the case in any fair com-
petition, there are winners and losers. But it’s instructive when we see losers, 
because it demonstrates that there is no “club membership” that an HFT 
receives by spending large sums of money, which entitle it to low‐risk prof-
its. Investment in good real estate, good technology, smart people, and other 
sources of potential advantage are exactly that: an investment that might 
pay off or might not.

t he p urpose of s peed
The second reason that the claim of a two‐tiered system is wrong is that 
HFTs do not use their fairly earned competitive advantage to compete with 
investors, but rather with each other . HFTs (particularly market makers) are 
in the business of facilitating investor orders, which means that they take 
the opposite side of these orders. As demonstrated in Chapter 14, obtaining 
a speed advantage over other HFTs is important to managing the adverse 
selection problems associated with passive trading.
It is incorrect to claim that a trader who does not want to accumulate a 
significant net position, and who prefers to end the day with no positions at 
all would be competing with an investor who has a time horizon measured 
in weeks, months, or years. Indeed, HFTs are enormous net providers of 
liquidity, while investors are net consumers of it.
This is borne out by the numbers. The enormous energy and cost ex-
pended on speed by HFTs can yield a strategy with a speed that can be meas-
ured. It comes to around $0.001 per share in U.S. equities, as mentioned 
earlier . The fastest traders in the market can earn profits in that range. Yes, 
of course they trade a lot of shares, but as we showed in Chapter 13, even 
in aggregate, HFT profits in U.S. equities are just over half of what even a 
single medium‐sized retail U.S. equity brokerage firm earns.
Let’s contrast these economics with those of a good statistical arbi -
trage trader . Such a firm can earn approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share. 
In this case, the extra $0.001 per share earned by having better infrastruc -
ture is useful, but only at the margin. In the case of a longer‐term investor , 
one with a return target measured in several (or many) dollars and tens 
of percentage points, earning an extra $0.001 per share on a typical trade 
does not move the needle. This is especially true because they don’t trade 
all that often.
Comparing the economics of HFT to the economics of longer‐term in-
vestors is another way to demonstrate that there is little or no competition 
across these types of participants. Instead, each has a role in the market’s 
ecosystem. The competition among HFTs exists because they are compet-
ing with each other to interact in the least adverse way with non‐HFT  
order flow.
a  p hilosophical p oint
Every advantage in investing, in particular in alpha‐driven investing, is about 
speed. Whether it is getting data faster , processing the information faster (or 
even processing the information better), or executing orders more quickly, 
investment ideas make money only if other people have similar ideas, after 

## Page 303

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  283
you have implemented yours. This is true of deep value investing as much as 
it is true of HFT investing.
This is a fundamental statement about alpha, and it ties in with the 
definition of alpha given in Chapter 3: Alpha is all about timing. In particu-
lar , it is about realizing value before others. Whether you are a long‐term 
active investor like Warren Buffett, a statistical arbitrageur , a trend‐follower 
in futures markets, or an HFT , you make money only when your longs go 
up and/or your shorts go down. This is only the case when other investors, 
in aggregate, follow in your footsteps. Perhaps this is the most important 
point to consider of all: Successful investing and trading rely inherently on a 
correct anticipation of the future aggregate behavior of other investors and 
traders. There is nothing special about anticipating someone’s trading versus 
anticipating someone’s longer‐term bets.
In sum, it’s hard to see any merit in the idea that HFT is unfair or creates 
a two‐tiered marketplace. HFTs do have some advantages over the average 
person, but then again, so does every person with an above‐average IQ, or 
even an above‐average expenditure of time and money on analysis of invest-
ment or trading decisions. That advantage, in every class of active investing 
from long‐term money management to HFT , is fundamentally about speed. 
Specifically, it is about getting into positions before other people get the 
same ideas, and getting out before it is too late to retain profits. This leads 
directly to the second question about HFTs.
Does h F t  Lea D  to Front- rU nning or  
m
arket

ation?
HFTs are accused of front‐running investors. This is a topic that understand-
ably generates a lot of heat. But unfortunately, it also generates very little by 
way of credible examples to examine. As far as market manipulation, in the 
rare cases that the arguments get specific, detractors point to such practices 
as quote stuffing, which involves placing and canceling huge numbers of or-
ders in order to confound others into making mistakes. Another favorite of 
critics is that “their [HFTs’] computers can essentially bully slower investors 
into giving up profits—and then disappear before anyone even knows they 
were there,”
3 which usually doesn’t get further explanation. Events that are 
entirely unrelated to HFT , such as Facebook’s troubled IPO in 2012, have 
been deemed by some in the press and public to be an HFT manipulation 
problem.
The manipulation claim seems to have its roots in the case of 
 
Goldman 
Sachs sending the Feds after Sergey Aleynikov (as we described in 
Chapter 13). That case (until Aleynikov’s conviction was dismissed and 

## Page 304

284  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
vacated) gave  people who were suspicious about how anyone could make 
money in 2008 an aha moment. In their statements about the sensitivity 
of the code that was alleged to have been stolen, the indubitable Goldman 
claimed that “there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this 
program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways. ” 4 We will ad-
dress both claims here.
Front- r unning
Let’s be really explicit: Front‐running occurs when a fiduciary uses knowl-
edge of his customer’s order to buy or sell to perform that same action 
before the customer has the opportunity to do so. But HFTs aren’t look-
ing at customer orders and then deciding whether to front‐run them. They 
are forecasting into the extremely near‐term future, and sometimes they are 
speculating about what other traders might do next. As we pointed out 
in the section entitled “Does HFT Create Unfair Competition?,” timing is 
everything for all kinds of alpha‐driven investors, and much of the exercise 
in timing relates to anticipating what others might do later . But most HFTs 
are not getting information about customer orders before they go out to the 
market. Mostly, they are responding to such orders, but that’s what most 
traders have always done, with or without computers.
Some HFTs (arbitrageurs and HFT alpha traders) are reacting to fleet-
ing inefficiencies caused by others’ orders to reap profits. Noncontractual 
market makers (NCMMs) react to the limit order book and other informa-
tion to place passive orders. They have no knowledge of the trades that 
others plan to make, and they do not see orders before those orders hit 
the market. Contractual market makers (CMMs) actually do see customer 
order flow and have requirements to provide liquidity on that order flow. 
Ironically, it is here where front‐running is actually theoretically possible, 
in contrast to the other scenarios just mentioned. However , it is rare that 
a CMM is the subject of the public’s ire against HFTs. In fact, some critics 
want all HFTs to become CMMs, with obligations like those CMMs have. 
This would have the perverse consequence of giving all HFTs a look at order 
flow before it hits the tape.
A pet phrase of HFT’s detractors is latency arbitrage, which is a stylized 
strategy that is supposed to demonstrate how an HFT can utilize a preda-
tory algorithm to front‐run an institutional trader’s execution algorithm. It 
is a story that begins with a premise that an HFT can see a customer order 
before it hits the tape, and then walks through how this information would 
be used to front‐run an order . It is further claimed that this kind of preda-
tory practice generates $1.5 to $3 billion in profits annually for HFTs in the 
U.S. equity market alone.

## Page 305

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  285
It is true that, if an HFT could actually see the order before it hits the 
tape, it would be able to front‐run a customer order . If we grant the premise, 
the rest of the argument is trivial and follows directly. However , the premise 
is completely false.
The scenario imagined is that, when this order is placed, it takes some 
time to be reflected in the national best bid‐offer (NBBO), due to the latency 
we have described already in updating this centralized data feed. As we have 
also pointed out, to combat this latency, many HFTs establish direct data 
feeds from the exchanges. Thus, it is true that they can see the customer’s 
order before it is reflected in the centralized tape. However—and this is 
the central flaw in the claim being addressed—the customer’s order has to 
already be in the queue at a given exchange for an HFT with a direct data 
feed to see it.
There is no conceivable way that an HFT could see the order before 
it happens. It is true that, relative to someone relying on the consolidated 
tape, the HFT will be able to be better aware of the actual current order 
book. And there are clearly advantages to having timely information, or 
else it would be stupid for an HFT to bother establishing expensive and 
hard‐to‐manage direct feeds. But this advantage comes at a cost, and it is a 
cost any participant is welcome to bear for himself to compete. If a trader’s 
strategy requires feeds to be as timely as an HFT , then it is probable he will 
go through all the trouble. If not, then he will not. But this is no different 
from establishing any other kind of competitive advantage in any industry 
(see “Does HFT Create Unfair Competition?”).
It seems to me that HFT’s opponents have misunderstood the difference 
between being faster than others and front‐running them. Front‐running is 
illegal, and it basically doesn’t occur insofar as HFT is concerned. HFTs are, 
however , faster than most other market participants. Usain Bolt is faster 
than most other sprinters. He wins medals, and we marvel at his speed. We 
are not surprised that a marathoner cannot run 100 meters as quickly as 
Bolt, and we do not attempt to compare the “fastest man in the world” with 
the “fastest marathoner in the world. ” This is because it would be strange 
to do so: They are competing in different games. Bolt is not trying to outrun 
Patrick Makau (record‐holder for fastest marathon). Just so, HFTs are not 
trying to front‐run pension investors (nor could they, given the basic fact 
that the pension fund’s orders go directly to the market). They are compet-
ing in different games.
Imagine a world in which there are no computerized trading strate -
gies, no execution algorithms. In such a world, some traders would still 
have the ability to access and process information faster and more accu -
rately than others. And those traders would outwit the less capable and 
make a profit doing so. This is completely normal and acceptable. And 

## Page 306

286  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
the analogy is identical in the case of HFTs. They do not have access to 
customer order flow before the fact. They can find out what the customer 
flow was as soon as possible after the fact, and they can attempt to react 
very quickly to that information. This, too, is completely normal and 
totally acceptable.
m anipulation and Cancellation r ates
Focusing now on manipulation, some have claimed that HFTs manipulate 
markets, either by moving prices or as a result of their high order cancella-
tion rates. The troubled Facebook IPO in 2012 has been used as an example 
of this supposed manipulation by some observers. As it turns out, the prob-
lems at the opening of Facebook’s IPO were specifically driven by technol-
ogy problems at Nasdaq. What this has to do with HFTs is not something 
I have the ability to imagine. It also appears lost on those pointing to the 
Facebook IPO as evidence of an HFT manipulation problem that the price 
dropped and remained well below the IPO price at least up until the time of 
this writing (five months to the day after the IPO date, FB is approximately 
50 percent below its IPO price).
But let’s imagine that some bad actor in the HFT world does decide to 
manipulate markets or engage in quote stuffing. Should someone using a 
powerful tool for illegal purposes bring judgment on himself or on the tool 
he used? Should speculative trading be banned because the Hunt brothers 
cornered and manipulated the silver markets beginning in the 1970s (with-
out the use of any technology more sophisticated than a telephone)? For 
that matter , should telephones be banned, since they can and have been used 
for evil purposes?
But we need not grant that HFTs engage in manipulative practices. Ma-
nipulation usually requires a trader to acquire a large enough inventory of 
a position to move the market. But considering our definition of an HFT , 
this is not in line with an HFT’s requirement to get out of positions by the 
end of the day. Inventory, as we’ve seen, is generally not desirable to an 
HFT . So there is a logical inconsistency between the contention that HFTs 
manipulate markets and the fact that they dislike holding positions. The 
reality is that anyone with sufficient means and motivation can attempt to 
manipulate markets.
Critics have also pointed to the frequency with which HFTs cancel their 
orders (known as cancellation rates) as a way to manipulate markets at 
a micro level. A high rate of entering and cancelling orders is referred to 
as quote stuffing. Opponents of HFT claim that there are two problems 
with high cancellation rates: first, that high cancellation rates imply that 
the liquidity that we think we see is either not there at all or it is of inferior

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  287
quality; second, that HFTs manipulate markets by overwhelming exchanges 
with massive message volumes due to placing and canceling too many or -
ders. There are a number of problems with these arguments, but first, let’s 
understand why cancellation rates are and should be high, if the market is 
functioning correctly.
We demonstrated in Chapter 14 the importance of queue placement in 
placing and canceling passive orders. Time priority markets (such as the U.S. 
equity markets) require that a passive trader be fast on his feet if he doesn’t 
want to get picked off. Since much of the HFT world is passive, there is a 
great deal of competition to provide liquidity to active traders. This compe-
tition is good for the active trader , because it means that her trade will get 
done at a good price. Every time the price changes in a market, every time 
there is a trade, this is new information that must be accounted for by the 
market maker . This usually means canceling a previously resting passive 
order and placing a new one. Decimalization of stocks led to an increased 
frequency of price changes, and this has in turn meant a permanently higher 
rate of cancellations.
Fragmentation in the U.S. equity market is another important contribu-
tor . Because there are over a dozen official exchanges under Reg NMS, and 
because the formation of the NBBO is so slow (as described in Chapter 14), 
many HFTs post orders directly to each exchange. But they are posting far 
more liquidity than they actually want to provide, and once they get filled 
on the size they are willing to trade, they must cancel the extra orders or risk 
being run over by active traders. This is some of the basic risk management 
that we described in Chapter 15, and it is a good thing that HFTs are careful 
about managing risk.
Finally, many new orders reach the market too late to be at or near the 
front of the queue. In these cases, allowing those orders to remain in the 
order book is very risky for market makers, for all the reasons we described 
in Chapter 14. As such, seeing that an order arrived too late is sufficiently 
good reason to cancel it.
Opponents of HFT claim that the liquidity being provided is merely a 
mirage, or if it is real, it is inferior . Unfortunately, there is no evidence to 
support these claims. But the facts are what they are: The average NBBO 
quote on SPY , which is the highest volume stock in the world, had an aver-
age duration of over three seconds in the first half of 2010.
4 A typical stock 
has lower volumes and longer NBBO quote durations. These numbers are 
not different from what opponents claim to have been true in the pre‐HFT 
days of 2004.5
HFT’s opponents also contend that high message rates (which occur 
when there is a high volume of orders and cancellations) cause delays for 
exchanges, which buys the HFT time (to do what, I’m not sure). It is true 

## Page 308

288  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
that, when message volumes spike, exchanges must deal with the same 
microbursting problem (Chapter 14) as HFTs have to solve, and at the 
extremes, the exchanges do see delays. But slowing down message traffic 
would serve no economic purpose for an HFT . Indeed, during the Flash 
Crash, many HFTs who stopped trading did so specifically because data 
latencies were getting to such a level that they felt their data quality had 
deteriorated so much that they couldn’t responsibly continue trading. Data 
latency is an enemy to an HFT , not a friend.
Furthermore, if exchanges were being hampered by HFTs, it is easy 
enough for them to do something about it. Indeed, exchanges do monitor 
the message traffic from each participant that connects to them, and they 
warn, sanction, and if necessary ban traders who generate excess traffic. 
This is a completely rational and acceptable way to handle the situation, 
because not all exchanges have the same capacity to handle messages. An 
artificial message limit would be too low for some and too high for oth-
ers, and would add an arbitrary element to the healthy competition among 
 exchanges.
A minimum resting time, which would disallow the immediate cancel-
lation of an order , has also been suggested. The proximate effect of such 
a change would be that a large proportion of all orders would be very 
stale, and that such stale orders would offer new and very fruitful arbitrage 
opportunities to HFTs. For example, imagine that the NBBO on the SPY 
shows 1,000 shares bid at $144.20 and 1,000 shares offered at $144.21, 
and if these are freshly made orders that must rest for some time. Now 
imagine that the S&P futures move rapidly downward just at that time. The 
trader whose 1,000 share bid at $144.20 is stuck because of a minimum 
resting time would see it get filled happily by an active order from an index 
arbitrageur , who would subsequently be able, quite possibly, to immediately 
buy back the short position at a lower price. Remember , based on what we 
showed in Chapter 14, the main reason a passive order would get canceled 
is to avoid being picked off. Requiring that a liquidity-providing pas-
sive trader allow himself to be picked off, in order to solve a nonexistent 
problem, doesn’t seem likely to be an effective improvement to the current  
market structure.
As a final note, an academic paper published in September 2012 took 
the first-ever detailed, empirical look at the impact of HFTs on market ma-
nipulation.
6 The authors analyzed 22 stock exchanges around the world 
from January 2003 through June 2011. Their findings:
Controlling for country, market, legal and other differences across 
exchanges and over time, and using a variety of robustness checks in-
cluding difference‐in‐differences tests, we show that the presence of 

## Page 309

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  289
high frequency trading in some markets has significantly mitigated 
the frequency and severity of end‐of‐day manipulation, counter to 
recent concerns expressed in the media. The effect of HFT is more 
pronounced than the role of trading rules, surveillance, enforcement 
and legal conditions in curtailing the frequency and severity of end‐
of‐day manipulation. We show our findings are robust to different 
measures of end‐of‐day manipulation, including but not limited to 
option expiry dates, among other things.

Occasionally, computer software has glitches. When one of those glitches 
leads to millions of erroneous orders, causing huge instability in market 
prices, people feel that they should be worried. Furthermore, even without 
the presence of bugs in someone’s code, events like the Flash Crash of 2010 
lead to speculation that HFTs are to blame for extreme market volatility. 
Indeed, it remains fairly widely asserted that the Flash Crash was a com-
puter‐driven event, despite both an abundance of evidence to the contrary 
and none in favor of such a theory. Even an SEC report on the event, which 
exonerated HFTs about as clearly as could be done by a government report, 
made no dent in the perception that HFTs were to blame.
Aside from the Flash Crash, other events have not helped the public 
relations efforts for HFT . For example, an HFT firm named Infinium was 
probed in August 2010 for a bug in its HFT programs that led to a $1 in-
crease in the price of crude oil in about one second. So are HFTs responsible 
for instability and volatility?
As was the case with the arguments already discussed, HFTs are accused 
of things that are equally or more applicable to other forms of trading. For 
every HFT problem or computer hiccup, there is a Mizuho securities trader 
who accidentally sold 600,000 shares of a stock at 1 yen each, instead of 
1 share at 600,000 yen. Not to pick on the Japanese, but another fat fin-
ger error only a few months later had another trader buy 2,000 shares of 
a stock that traded at 510,000 yen, instead of 2 shares, costing his firm  
$10 million in losses. An entertaining article in the Financial News, a Dow 
Jones publication, from March 2007
7 listed 10 human‐driven trading er -
rors of breathtaking scope, including one for more than $100 billion worth 
of stock in a European pharmaceutical; another involving a trader whose 
elbow touched an Instant Sell key on his keyboard, leading to a massive  
futures order in French government bonds; another order where a trader 

## Page 310

290  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
carelessly attempted to transact more than £8.1 billion worth of shares 
(nearly four times the company’s market capitalization); and another where 
someone wrongly entered the 6‐digit SEDOL identifier for a stock in the size 
field of an order , leading to a £60 million loss; and so on.
Whether HFTs cause volatility even in the absence of glitches is a dif-
ferent question, which we will address empirically. However , this question is 
worth putting in context. It is clearly a matter of real concern if investors are 
systematically overpaying for their transactions. Such overpayment could 
certainly occur if an investor transacts due to heightened short-term volatil-
ity. And if HFTs are a driver of heightened short-term volatility, then there is 
both a fair and a very real concern to be addressed. But common sense gives 
us the same answer as a thorough empirical analysis.
We have had, and we continue to have, serious economic and geopoliti-
cal problems weighing on the markets. The 1929 market crash that kicked 
off the Great Depression, the spike in inflation and bond yields that crushed 
most assets in the 1970s, the decades‐long stagnation in Japan’s economy 
and capital markets, the 1998 LTCM/Russian‐driven crash, the dot‐com 
bubble and the subsequent 50 percent decline in stocks that took years to 
recover , the financial debacle of 2008 (from which we still haven’t fully re-
covered), and the problems in Greek and other Eurozone sovereigns are all 
by orders of magnitude more significant drivers of volatility than HFT will 
likely ever be. Neither computers nor HFTs play any role in these real eco-
nomic issues, which seem to be the kinds of things with which real money 
investors are (and should be) primarily concerned.
a n e mpirical a nalysis of h F t s and Volatility
Empirical analysis supports the claim that HFTs are not responsible for 
volatility. Critics point out that volatility in the S&P 500 has climbed since 
HFTs have gained prominence. A September 2011 article in the New York 
Times was titled “Market Swings Are Becoming New Standard. ”
8 It argues 
that the stock market is more likely to “make large swings—on the order 
of 3 percent or 4 percent—than it has been any other time in recent stock 
market history. ” It goes on to list HFT as one of the probable causes. In an 
article for the High Frequency Traders website, Manoj Narang dissects this 
argument and provides an empirical study of the sources of volatility.
9 Let’s 
update and build on that analysis here.
The S&P 500 goes through two distinct phases in any given 24‐hour 
period. The first is the period during which the market is open. We can 
measure the behavior of the S&P while it’s open by comparing the opening 
price and a closing price. The second period is when the market is closed. 
T o understand the behavior of the market during this period, we can look at 

## Page 311

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  291
one day’s closing price and the next day’s opening price. These two mutually 
exclusive segments (open:close and close:open) add up to the behavior of 
the index from one day’s close to the next day’s close.
HFTs are active during the trading day. They are almost all dormant 
overnight (remember , they tend to take home no overnight positions). Much 
of the news that impacts markets comes out overnight (though some, for 
example, the Federal Open Market Committee’s announcements, are intra-
day phenomena). As such, we can take as a rule of thumb that overnight 
(close:open) volatility is unrelated to HFTs, while intraday volatility could 
be related to HFTs (or other news and events that occur intraday). One 
of the errors that the aforementioned New York Times article makes is to 
point out that close‐to‐close volatility has gone up since HFTs have gained 
prominence. But we can do a better job of understanding the sources of this 
increase by examining the behavior of the market while it is closed, versus 
when HFTs are active (while the market is open).
For this analysis, we look at four quantities and compare them during 
two distinct periods. The first quantity is the absolute value of the percent 
change in the S&P from one day’s close to the next (close:close). The 
 
second 
quantity is the absolute value of the percent change in the S&P from the 
open to the close of a single day (open:close). The third compares the ab-
solute value of the percent change in the S&P from one day’s close to the 
next day’s open (close:open). The final quantity is the absolute value of the 
percent change from the intraday high to the intraday low for a single day. 
We took data from January 1, 2000, through September 2012, and drew a 
dividing line at January 1, 2007. This is because Reg NMS was enacted dur-
ing 2007, which changed market structure to what it is today. Furthermore, 
the post‐2007 period is clearly when HFTs became most active. If the critics 
are right, we should see the open:close volatility increase at least as much as 
the close:close volatility, since that’s the only time that HFTs could possibly 
affect prices.
Comparing the close:close results, we find that the S&P 500 (as meas-
ured using the SPY ETF) averaged 0.84 percent changes from 2000 to 2006, 
and 1.03 percent changes from 2007 to 2012. This is a 23 percent increase 
in the magnitude of the index’s movements, and is the primary evidence 
used to support the contention that HFTs have caused increased volatil-
ity. However , if we divide the data into the natural partitions we described 
(close:open and open:close), we see a different picture. This is shown in 
Exhibit 16.1.
What is clear from this table is that, while volatility (measured in this 
way) has increased overall from 2007 onward, the increase is actually much 
smaller intraday than it is overnight. The increase in the average of the 
gap from high to low within a day is also much smaller than the increase  

## Page 312

292  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
in overnight volatility. These data clearly indicate that market volatility has 
increased for reasons that have nothing to do with HFTs.
Examining the median movements of the S&P instead of the averages 
shows an even more stark contrast, as shown in Exhibit 16.2. Here, we see 
that volatility has actually not increased all that much, and that intraday 
volatility has actually contracted somewhat since the rise of HFTs! By con-
trast, and consistent with what we saw from the analysis of average move-
ments, overnight volatility has spiked according to this measure as well.
We can also examine whether larger moves have become more frequent. 
T o answer this question, we looked at the frequency of moves of 3 percent 
or greater in the same way, as shown in Exhibit 16.3. Here, we see an in-
crease in volatility measured in each way, but the pattern of increases in 
overnight volatility far outstripping intraday volatility holds.
It becomes more interesting as we examine even larger moves. What we 
see is that, when counting the frequency of larger moves (4 percent or more), 
the instances have become more common in the intraday period than from 
close to close, while the high versus low volatility increase continues to lag. 
This is shown in Exhibit 16.4.
At these more extreme levels, it appears that overnight volatility plays 
less of a role than intraday volatility in explaining the increase in the fre-
quency of very large moves since 2007. However , even here, the picture is 
mixed. First, while the intraday volatility increases more as the magnitude 
of the move goes up, we see that the high versus low volatility increases at 
a slower pace overall. Second, as we begin to examine these outlier events,

we are dealing with events that happen very infrequently. For example, out 
of the 1,448 trading days since January 1, 2007, we have seen only 20 in-
stances where intraday moves were at least 4 percent. As such, it would be 
unwise to draw any serious conclusions from these data.
However , one could contend that HFTs’ association with market vola-
tility is as follows: Most of the time their activities coincide with lower 
volatility, but in the most extreme cases, their activities coincide with higher 
volatility. Even if we make a grave statistical error and mistake coincidence 
for causation, the most damning argument against HFTs could be that, in 
the 20 instances where the market moved at least 4 percent in an intraday 
period over the last five and a half years, HFTs may have contributed to 
those large moves to some unknowable degree. Other investors surely will 
also bear some of the blame. But for the other 1,428 days, HFTs reduced 
volatility.
One major reason that the data support the claim that HFTs reduce 
volatility is that a strategy that buys and sells roughly the same amount 
during a fixed time period cannot cause any net price impact on the instru -
ment being traded. Whatever price impact was generated on the buying of 
a position is realized in the opposite direction when selling it. And with -
out impact, the probability that volatility, even measured on the slowest 
timescale attributable to HFTs (one day), is related to HFTs is effectively 
nil. The definition of HFTs logically precludes one from drawing such a 
conclusion.

Furthermore, it is a basic fact of capital markets that posting limit or -
ders, which is a huge part of the activity of HFTs, does not cause volatility, 
but rather reduces it. Every single order in the order book represents a fric-
tion that must be overcome before the market can move through the price 
levels presented in the order book. Illiquidity breeds volatility, not an abun-
dance of liquidity. This fact seems lost on HFT’s opponents. Even in times of 
duress, when HFTs must trade actively, it is most often to liquidate positions 
that were acquired passively. This implies that even in stress scenarios, such 
as the one we will cover in depth next, HFTs are probably no worse than 
neutral to liquidity. In aggregate, it is extremely clear that they are liquidity 
providers.
t he Flash Crash
It took less than 20 minutes for many blue‐chip shares to drop by about 5 
percent. In smaller capitalization companies, the moves were worse. Bruns-
wick Corp fell 9.3 percent in 12 minutes (more than 22 percent from its 
opening price). There was massive volume, enough to cause the NYSE to 
take almost two and a half hours after the market close to finish report-
ing floor transactions. Market makers were found to have exacerbated the 
downdraft by turning from buyers to sellers. There was chaos in the prices 
of some executions relative to what they should probably have been, given 
the prevailing market. There was widespread disgust and disappointment 
in the integrity of capital markets, and many brokerage firms saw reduced 
volumes and earnings in the wake of this event. These events occurred on 
May 29, 1962.
10 But they hold some important parallels and equally impor-
tant lessons in considering the Flash Crash of 2010. The reality is that, just 
as real, deep crises occur in markets without any help from computers or 
HFTs, so do rapid fluctuations in prices.
The causes of the 2010 Flash Crash are several. First, and most impor -
tantly, the markets were already jittery from a brewing sovereign debt crisis 
in Europe and a very tentative economic recovery in the United States. The 
stock market was already down several percentage points for the day be-
fore the first spike down around 2:40 p .m. The role of negative short‐term 
sentiment on the part of a wide array of market participants should not be 
discounted. It was the single largest cause of the Flash Crashes of both 1962 
and 2010.
Second, Waddell & Reed, an established mutual fund manager , entered 
a large (somewhat inelegant, and fully discretionary) order to sell S&P fu-
tures.
11 The face value of this order was approximately $4.1 billion, and 
at a time when the market was already down, this order exacerbated price 
movements enough to trigger further selling, for example from stop‐losses 

## Page 315

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  295
and other kinds of stop‐orders. The order was entered around 2:30 p .m. on 
May 6, 2010, and at that point, the S&P 500 was already down 2.5 percent 
for the day. There is little doubt that this 75,000 contract order , which took 
20 minutes to execute, was a driver of the volatility that ensued. In particu-
lar , their trading algorithm was designed to ignore price movements and 
merely focus on volume levels as the determinant of the size of each order 
placed. But since their own order was causing others to panic, volumes in-
creased, and their 75,000 contract order became the center of a snowball. It 
is important to point out that there is no judgment assigned to these facts. 
Waddell’s order was perfectly legitimate, with no evil intent behind it. It 
was their right to enter it, and what transpired afterward has no bearing on  
that fact.
Third, the interconnectedness of instruments across various exchanges 
and instrument classes (e.g., S&P futures to S&P exchange‐traded funds 
[ETFs] to the constituents of these ETFs, to the names that are peers of those 
constituents) in U.S. equities had a role in the propagation of these volatile 
moves across the marketplace. As we described in talking about index ar -
bitrage in Chapter 15, the prices of structurally correlated instruments will 
tend to move together . So, when S&P futures fell, the ETFs that track the 
same index moved in lockstep. So did the stocks that are constituents of the 
S&P 500 (and the ETFs that contain those). Then, statistical correlations 
dictated that other , similar stocks should follow suit. There is little judg-
ment on this fact, either . It is generally a good thing to have many ways to 
express an investment idea. Each structure offers some benefits and some 
drawbacks, and that they tend to move lockstep with one another does not 
mean that there is some problem that needs to be solved.
Fourth, the fragmentation of the U.S. equity market played a role. 
The fragmentation itself was a procustomer change in market structure 
that really picked up steam in the late 1990s with the propagation of 
electronic communication networks (ECNs). The increased competition 
with the previously monopolistic stock exchanges drove costs lower and 
liquidity higher . But in this case, fragmentation did have a hand in the 
breakdown in liquidity due to the declaration of Self Help. Reg NMS al -
lows an exchange to cease participating and sharing information with the 
other market centers if there is a problem with one or more of them. The 
NYSE Arca exchange, for example, was alleged to have had problems with 
its technology, resulting from the huge increase in message traffic. (Re -
member our discussion about microbursts in Chapter 14? This is why they 
matter!) Several exchanges pointed to what they viewed as Arca’s prob -
lems and declared Self Help, which they are allowed to do if they find that 
some member of the market system is having problems. This exacerbated 
the fragmentation problem and reduced liquidity. It was a contributor to 

## Page 316

296  Hig H -Speed and Hig H -Frequency Trading
the stub quotes  issue that led to some shares being executed at obviously 
ridiculous prices.
Finally, the Flash Crash was exacerbated by the extremely reasonable 
decision by some (not nearly all) HFT speculators to cease trading. They 
are not required to make markets, and data latency times coming out of 
exchanges were severe. At a time when the market was clearly broken in 
several places, there is no judgment that should be cast against any trader 
who simply wants no part of some craziness in the markets. Note that, nev-
ertheless, volumes during the flash crash were spectacularly high, so either 
non‐HFT traders were doing many multiples of their normal order size, or 
else HFT traders weren’t as absent as is widely believed.
In sum, HFTs were not responsible for the Flash Crash, nor are they 
responsible for the very real economic problems we face currently. Can HFT 
cause market problems through glitches or misbehavior? Absolutely. But so 
can a lot of other things that aren’t HFTs. No one is talking about banning 
human traders because they often screw up spectacularly once in a while. 
Why should we have a double standard on computerized traders? Regula-
tion is useful here, and there should always be repercussions for costly and 
careless errors. The first and most appropriate repercussion is that people 
who make dumb trades tend to lose money for themselves (e.g., Knight 
Capital). They have their investors to face, as well. But that sort of natural 
punishment, coupled with any required ex post enforcement, seems perfectly 
legitimate given the total lack of other valid options.
Does h F t  La C k s o C ia L  Va LU e?
This is perhaps the most disappointing argument I’ve heard against HFT . 
Actually its being infuriating has nothing to do with HFT at all. It is 
problematic in the philosophical outlook it implies, and disappointing in 
the writers who have furthered its acceptance by many. Paul 
 
Krugman, 
a brilliant Nobel‐laureate economist, actually made the argument in an 
op‐ed piece in the New York Times that HFT is generally a game of “bad 
actors,” and that it’s “hard to see how traders who place their orders 
one‐thirtieth of a second faster than anyone else do anything to improve 
that social function. ”
12 Allow me to state this explicitly. This is a cata -
strophically bad point of view, most especially for a self‐described liberal 
economist.
I don’t care about the fact, and it is a clear and indisputable fact despite 
all the rhetoric to the contrary, that HFTs actually provide an enormous 
amount of liquidity to the marketplace, which facilitates the trading activi-
ties of a great number of other types of players that are judged as having 

## Page 317

Controversy Regarding High-Frequency Trading  297
social value by those interested in casting such judgments. It’s irrelevant. The 
problem is far deeper with this argument.
The first question that is begged when someone raises the banner of so-
cial value is this: Who gets to decide what has social value and what doesn’t? 
What is the minimum holding period for an investor to be judged favorably 
as improving the social function of markets? Where do we stop with this 
analysis of social value? What about short‐sellers, who were indeed ques-
tioned and blamed heavily for the failures of Bear Stearns, AIG, and others 
in 2008? What about the makers of Bubble‐Yum, Snickers bars, Coca‐Cola, 
cigarettes, guns, fighter jets, and nuclear weapons? It seems like kind of a 
fascist line of thinking to raise the question of social value. What’s the social 
value of an economist? What’s the social value of a tobacco company or a 
gun manufacturer? Who gets to decide? It’s a free country, so people can 
say and do what they want, so long as they do not impinge on the rights of 
others. And this type of thinking leads directly to the impingement of others’ 
pursuits via its fallacious presumptions.

It’s true that computers are powerful tools, and that the more powerful a 
tool is, the greater amount of damage (or good) that it can do. But while that 
calls for scrutiny and sensible regulation, it does not call for the banning of 
the use of powerful tools.
Despite the hot‐headed talk from some outmoded corners of the mar -
ketplace, U.S. regulators have been surprisingly even‐headed and downright 
thoughtful about all this. So far , every real step they’ve taken with regard to 
HFT has actually seemed pretty fair . Banning naked access was a reasonable 
thing to do. The SEC’s report on the Flash Crash was even‐keeled, pretty 
accurate, and placed the responsibility (not the blame, which is something 
needed when there’s a real disaster) more or less in the right camps.
One of the most controversial measures being considered in the United 
States is a financial transaction tax (FTT). It is also one of the most stupid 
ideas regarding HFT and potential improvements to market structure. If the 
tax is not universal and global, then trading will simply move to markets 
where taxes are lower or are not applied at all. If taxes are universal and 
global, and if HFT becomes unprofitable as a result, volumes are likely to 
plummet, which reduces both the amount collected by the FTT and follow‐
on impacts to capital gains taxes. Declining volumes will also damage banks 
and brokerage firms severely, and it is probable that their least risky and 
most profitable units will be the hardest hit. Banks’ prime brokerage units 
are nearly riskless operations that generate large revenues from customers’

commissions. If customers are trading less, banks will make less. This prob-
ably implies a substantial loss in jobs, not just at the banks, but also at vari-
ous trading entities associated with the markets.
None of this has stopped 11 countries in the EU from adopting an FTT , 
but it will not be surprising if they follow the path Sweden has already been 
down. In 1984, Sweden enacted an FTT . Trading volumes across various as-
set classes in Sweden fell dramatically. Futures volumes were off 98 
 
percent, 
bond volumes dropped 80 percent, and the options market in Sweden dis-
appeared entirely. By 1990, Sweden’s equity markets lost more than half 
of their volumes to London’s exchanges. The fees collected were just over  
3 percent of what the Swedish Finance Ministry had forecasted, and the 
FTT actually cost the Swedish Treasury revenue in aggregate, because other 
taxable revenues on capital gains fell, more than offsetting the minuscule 
revenues that were achieved. It was repealed in 1991.
13 Needless to say, 
Sweden did not join the 11 countries that adopted the FTT in October 2012.
The irony is that the tax is designed to “make the financial firms that 
got us into this mess pay their share for the recovery. ” But customers of 
financial firms (e.g., hedge funds and HFTs) certainly did not cause lax 
mortgage lending practices, CDOs, bogus AAA ratings, and so on. And it is 
customers of financial firms, not the financial firms, who will be paying this 
tax. It’s one thing if it’s just HFTs and hedge funds paying the tax. Maybe 
most people wouldn’t care. But the Dutch Central Bank (DCB) “opposes the 
introduction of a European financial transaction tax that it estimated would 
cost the nation’s lenders, pension funds and insurers about €4 billion and 
hurt economic growth. ” The DCB concluded that more than 40 percent of 
the annual cost of an FTT in the Netherlands would be borne by pensions 
(€1.7 billion).
14
I don’t care much about the bluster in the press. I’ve been involved in 
hedge funds for over 16 years now, and when I got started, few knew what 
a hedge fund even was. When they did, it was in the form of vilification 
(Soros for attacking Asian currencies, LTCM for nearly destroying the fi-
nancial markets, and so on). We get paid pretty well, and if not being liked 
by someone who trusts what he reads in the news to be the whole story is 
the cost of that compensation, I’ll take that trade every day. I only hope that 
those with the power to actually make changes continue to take construc-
tive steps, rather than heeding the biased and/or uninformed voices of a very 
loud minority with regard to HFT . And certainly, we should be very, very 
wary of the unintended consequences of taking bad advice from ignorant, 
shortsighted, or biased people.
Some reasonable ideas to improve market structure do exist. Circuit 
breakers, which have long been proposed (and used, in markets like futures) 
are an effective way to cool down overheated markets. Ending the ban on

locked markets would go a very long way toward eliminating one of the 
most severe inefficiencies in the U.S. equity market, which would further 
eliminate the need for ISO orders (which are, for all practical purposes, una-
vailable to most investors, since the broker must determine that the investor 
is capable of complying with Reg NMS, which most investors cannot do). 
Liquidity provision rebates are currently tiered, so that the most active par-
ticipants get the best rebate tiers. While rebates themselves are a good thing 
(as they make it worthwhile to accept the risk of providing liquidity), tiered 
rebates make it impossible for lower‐volume customers to profitably post 
passive orders. Moving toward a much flatter (or entirely flat) rebate struc-
ture would solve this problem. And, finally, it behooves regulators to begin 
to arm themselves with technology that will enable them to properly moni-
tor and police the markets. This appears to be well understood by now, and 
we are beginning to see the SEC take significant steps in the right direction.
sU mmary
In general, and let me say this clearly, HFTs are not run by evil people. They 
stay well within both the rules of the markets and the boundaries of com-
mon ethics and good sense. They often self‐report any irregularities caused 
by their trading to the authorities. That the powerful computers and fast 
communication lines they possess might be used to manipulate the market 
doesn’t mean that legitimate activities undertaken with these tools must be 
stopped. Just as people are prosecuted for calling in fake bomb threats, so 
should people be prosecuted for manipulation, front‐running, and other bad 
behaviors in the markets. But there has been no evidence that computerized 
traders are especially guilty of such activities, and there is certainly no logic 
to a call to ban their activities because of a few examples of corruption.
Let us remember that some people have to be told what’s right and 
wrong, and they have to be punished for ignoring the rules. We Americans 
had to be told it was wrong to hold slaves, and wrong to force our children 
to work as coal miners and chimney sweeps, and so on. That doesn’t make 
farming or all farmers bad. It doesn’t make families or all parents bad. It 
unfortunately makes regulations and their proper enforcement absolutely 
required, because otherwise some people will go too far . Even with good 
regulations and enforcement, this still happens. But there’s no cure for the 
vices of humanity.
HFT isn’t evil any more than walking your dog is evil. Nor should it be 
banned any more than walking one’s dog should be banned. Yes, some dog 
owners will let their dog crap on your lawn and simply walk away, leaving 
the souvenir behind. That doesn’t make dogs bad; it makes the dog’s owner

sort of antisocial, and well‐deserving of some punishment. Computers, even 
when used for trading, are programmed by people. If those people are mali-
cious or careless, they will hurt others, and they should be prosecuted.
But people have been hurting others through malice and carelessness for 
far longer than we’ve had computers, ECNs, or dark fiber . T o take the atten-
tion off of the humans that engage in the activities that are harmful, and to 
focus on the instrument they use to cause harm, is folly. Furthermore, nearly 
every single serious academic study undertaken has either demonstrated 
that HFTs have empirically added liquidity and improved price discovery, or 
demonstrated that there is no evidence to support the idea that HFTs have 
created additional volatility or decreased market efficiency. The most critical 
papers often remark that problems can arise from HFT , but they are quick 
to note that such problems have arisen before HFT , and continue to arise 
due to other factors since the advent of HFT . An excellent and recent sum-
mary, which is also full of further references, can be found at the Foresight 
Project, which was conducted by the UK Government Office for Science, 
using leading academics from 20 countries.

All evolution in thought and conduct must at first appear as heresy 
and misconduct.
—George Bernard Shaw
S
o‐called black‐box trading has existed for more than three decades. It is 
hopefully clearer to the reader that these strategies are not so much black 
boxes as much as systematic implementations of the kinds of things that 
human traders and investors have always done. Unfortunately, automation 
is most often received with a great deal of distress. Sometimes, this is very 
understandable, as in the case of job displacement where a person’s occupa-
tion is being obviated by automation. Other times, ignorance is a sufficient 
reason for fear . In either case, I believe that the backlash against quants is, 
at its core, a generational issue. We are just past a point of transition in our 
marketplace. Automation and computerization in the markets have pretty 
much happened. But it’s still a recent enough phenomenon that companies 
and individuals who are poorly equipped to participate profitably in the 
modern markets are bitter and vocal. But as these types of players adapt, 
move into other lines of work, or retire, newer participants who are per -
fectly happy to participate in these markets are abundant.
Looking ahead, I see a couple of interesting trends that bear watching. 
Markets today are undoubtedly and categorically more fair and egalitarian 
than they have ever been in their history. However , the level of transparency 
available today, coupled with the level of technology at the disposal of even 
less sophisticated market participants and observers, has led to a continu-
ous pressure to ensure that markets are simply fair , not merely less unfair .  

## Page 324

I think that at least some of the elements that cause problems (e.g., the ban 
on locked markets) will be addressed.
At the same time, there is light at the end of tunnel in this low‐latency 
arms race. We are rapidly converging on that asymptotic limit of minimal 
latency. Most practitioners welcome such a state for the markets, because it 
will cause the focus of market participants back onto the more interesting 
challenges of outsmarting one another , rather than simply outrunning one 
another . It also seems likely that, once we reach this point, firms will have 
less reason to each rebuild the same standard, highest‐performance infra-
structure. This standardization of the platform will also deal with many of 
the (unfounded) criticisms of HFT , because everyone will have access to the 
same infrastructure.
Since the time I wrote the first edition of this book, I have seen lit-
tle progress in the areas of research I highlighted then. Relatively naive, 
frequently ineffective approaches remain in place to blend alpha models 
together , to size positions correctly, and to manage risk. These are fields of 
research in which little useful literature has been published, and the land-
scape remains wide open for innovation. And some fields of study within 
the quant trading industry have been ignored almost entirely. Models that 
predict whether certain strategies are likely to perform well or poorly in the 
future are also somewhat uncommon, though they are increasingly being 
explored by various systematic trading firms.
The manner in which quant trading systems are used can also evolve. 
There are already examples of hybrid quant‐discretionary strategies, which 
utilize quant systems to screen for opportunities while allowing discretion 
to rule the rest of the process. But more work can be done to ascertain 
whether certain other parts of the investment process can combine human 
subjectivity with the objectivity and consistency of machines. For example, 
it is easy to imagine analysts inputting their views into a computer system 
and allowing the system to determine the portfolio. In other words, instead 
of using machines to support human decisions, human input could support 
systematic decisions. At least one very prominent discretionary equity trad-
ing firm has established an effort in this area, and the initial results have 
apparently been very promising.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, and due largely to the ever‐
 
increasing power of computer processors, sophisticated machine learning 
approaches are becoming more and more feasible. There remains the chal-
lenge of extremely noisy, dirty data. But for those who can tackle this chal-
lenge, there may be interesting temporal inefficiencies to exploit for profit, 
particularly with regard to shorter‐term trading strategies.
Big data is a term borrowed from the tech industry, relating to datasets 
so large as to outstrip the capabilities of standard database tools. In quant 

## Page 325

Looking to the Future of Quant Trading  305
trading, it refers to large datasets that usually come from the Internet and 
that may give insight into sentiment. For example, numerous strategies have 
cropped up that analyze Twitter , blogs, and other Internet content sources 
to try to determine if sentiment readings can predict near‐term stock price 
movements.
There appears to be an interesting opportunity set at the intersection of 
high frequency and more traditional quant trading strategies. These “mid‐
frequency” strategies have shorter holding periods than traditional quant 
strategies and are focused heavily on alpha. But the kinds of opportuni-
ties they pursue—for example, using the limit order book to predict price 
behavior with a time horizon of an hour or longer—require the technical 
infrastructure needed to do well in high-frequency trading. As such, these 
mid‐frequency strategies are at the borderline between two equally diffi-
cult‐to‐master styles, and the opportunity set is interesting perhaps specifi-
cally because the barriers to entry are so high. As high-frequency trading 
has become more challenging in many markets, with volumes declining and 
competition at a fierce level, this may become an interesting area to observe. 
So far , we have seen a few HFT firms venture into the asset management 
business, and the success of these ventures has not been heartening (though 
it is extremely early yet). That said, the demand for short‐term quant strate-
gies appears to be high, and capital has been allocated aggressively in this 
area at a time when it has been difficult to generate profits.
It has been interesting to see an increased acceptance of systematic trad-
ing strategies by investors who had felt them too opaque previously. During 
2012, I know of billions of dollars allocated to quant funds specifically by 
pensions and large, traditional fund‐of‐funds who historically would have 
said, “We don’t invest in quant. ” However , far too much of this money is 
going to bulge‐bracket asset gathering outfits who care more about asset 
gathering than generating alpha.
Indeed, and at least partially because of this trend to allocate money 
primarily to the largest managers, the last five years have seen enormous 
 
turnover at the company and individual level among boutiques. A great 
many well‐respected quant trading outfits have closed down, while a large 
number more have entered the space. The quant liquidation of 2007, 
Lehman’s collapse in 2008, and the hedge fund industry’s institutionalization 
have all contributed to this trend. The implementation of the Dodd‐Frank 
 
prohibition on proprietary trading by banks has also led to a large flow of 
talent out of the industry. Many quants, like many other people around the 
world, are simply unemployed and have few prospects. I expect that a col-
lectivist approach to some of the more tiresome and expensive aspects of 
building a quant strategy will be centralized and shared. Prime candidates 
for such a business structure include data acquisition and 
 
management, 

## Page 326

operations and compliance management, and execution. However , raising 
trading capital remains a huge challenge for smaller firms and any startups 
that are not headed by brand name quants.
In addition to the general requirement to evolve in order to survive, 
great challenges face the quant trader today. Regulations are becoming in-
creasingly hostile as both quant trading and hedge funds are demonized in 
the popular press. The economic problems that were exacerbated by large 
investment banks, failed IPOs, and a host of other ailments have been foist-
ed onto quants and HFTs without any regard for the facts. Ironically, the 
causality is actually in the opposite direction. Rather than causing prob-
lems, quants have mainly suffered because of the innumerable government 
interventions and geopolitical events that have rattled markets ever since 
late 2008. Many alternative investment professionals are turning away from 
quant trading in disgust after years of repeated once‐in‐a‐lifetime events. 
For quants, this may be a period of natural selection, in which the weaker or 
less lucky firms are forced out of the business while the stronger or luckier 
firms can survive only if they evolve.
