Praise for Advances in Financial Machine Learning
In his new book Advances in Financial Machine Learning, noted financial scholar
Marcos L´opez de Prado strikes a well-aimed karate chop at the naive and often statis-
tically overfit techniques that are so prevalent in the financial world today. He points
out that not only are business-as-usual approaches largely impotent in today’s high-
tech finance, but in many cases they are actually prone to lose money. But L´opez de
Prado does more than just expose the mathematical and statistical sins of the finance
world. Instead, he offers a technically sound roadmap for finance professionals to join
the wave of machine learning. What is particularly refreshing is the author’s empirical
approach—his focus is on real-world data analysis, not on purely theoretical meth-
ods that may look pretty on paper but which, in many cases, are largely ineffective in
practice. The book is geared to finance professionals who are already familiar with
statistical data analysis techniques, but it is well worth the effort for those who want
to do real state-of-the-art work in the field.”
Dr. David H. Bailey, former Complex Systems Lead,
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Co-discoverer of the
BBP spigot algorithm
“Finance has evolved from a compendium of heuristics based on historical financial
statements to a highly sophisticated scientific discipline relying on computer farms
to analyze massive data streams in real time. The recent highly impressive advances
in machine learning (ML) are fraught with both promise and peril when applied to
modern finance. While finance offers up the nonlinearities and large data sets upon
which ML thrives, it also offers up noisy data and the human element which presently
lie beyond the scope of standard ML techniques. To err is human, but if you really
want to f**k things up, use a computer. Against this background, Dr. L´opez de Prado
has written the first comprehensive book describing the application of modern ML
to financial modeling. The book blends the latest technological developments in ML
with critical life lessons learned from the author’s decades of financial experience in
leading academic and industrial institutions. I highly recommend this exciting book
to both prospective students of financial ML and the professors and supervisors who
teach and guide them.”
Prof. Peter Carr, Chair of the Finance and Risk Engineering
Department, NYU Tandon School of Engineering
“Marcos is a visionary who works tirelessly to advance the finance field. His writing is
comprehensive and masterfully connects the theory to the application. It is not often
you find a book that can cross that divide. This book is an essential read for both
practitioners and technologists working on solutions for the investment community.”
Landon Downs, President and Cofounder, 1QBit
“Academics who want to understand modern investment management need to read
this book. In it, Marcos L´opez de Prado explains how portfolio managers use machine
learning to derive, test, and employ trading strategies. He does this from a very
unusual combination of an academic perspective and extensive experience in indus-
try, allowing him to both explain in detail what happens in industry and to explain

## Page 3

how it works. I suspect that some readers will find parts of the book that they do not
understand or that they disagree with, but everyone interested in understanding the
application of machine learning to finance will benefit from reading this book.”
Prof. David Easley, Cornell University. Chair of the
NASDAQ-OMX Economic Advisory Board
“For many decades, finance has relied on overly simplistic statistical techniques
to identify patterns in data. Machine learning promises to change that by allowing
researchers to use modern nonlinear and highly dimensional techniques, similar to
those used in scientific fields like DNA analysis and astrophysics. At the same time,
applying those machine learning algorithms to model financial problems would be
dangerous. Financial problems require very distinct machine learning solutions.
Dr. L´opez de Prado’s book is the first one to characterize what makes standard
machine learning tools fail when applied to the field of finance, and the first one to
provide practical solutions to unique challenges faced by asset managers. Everyone
who wants to understand the future of finance should read this book.”
Prof. Frank Fabozzi, EDHEC Business School. Editor of
The Journal of Portfolio Management
“This is a welcome departure from the knowledge hoarding that plagues quantitative
finance. L´opez de Prado defines for all readers the next era of finance: industrial scale
scientific research powered by machines.”
John Fawcett, Founder and CEO, Quantopian
“Marcos has assembled in one place an invaluable set of lessons and techniques for
practitioners seeking to deploy machine learning techniques in finance. If machine
learning is a new and potentially powerful weapon in the arsenal of quantitative
finance, Marcos’s insightful book is laden with useful advice to help keep a curi-
ous practitioner from going down any number of blind alleys, or shooting oneself in
the foot.”
Ross Garon, Head of Cubist Systematic Strategies. Managing
Director, Point72 Asset Management
“The first wave of quantitative innovation in finance was led by Markowitz optimiza-
tion. Machine Learning is the second wave, and it will touch every aspect of finance.
L´opez de Prado’s Advances in Financial Machine Learning is essential for readers
who want to be ahead of the technology rather than being replaced by it.”
Prof. Campbell Harvey, Duke University. Former President of
the American Finance Association
“How does one make sense of todays’ financial markets in which complex algo-
rithms route orders, financial data is voluminous, and trading speeds are measured
in nanoseconds? In this important book, Marcos L´opez de Prado sets out a new
paradigm for investment management built on machine learning. Far from being a
“black box” technique, this book clearly explains the tools and process of financial

## Page 4

machine learning. For academics and practitioners alike, this book fills an important
gap in our understanding of investment management in the machine age.”
Prof. Maureen O’Hara, Cornell University. Former President of
the American Finance Association
“Marcos L´opez de Prado has produced an extremely timely and important book on
machine learning. The author’s academic and professional first-rate credentials shine
through the pages of this book—indeed, I could think of few, if any, authors better
suited to explaining both the theoretical and the practical aspects of this new and
(for most) unfamiliar subject. Both novices and experienced professionals will find
insightful ideas, and will understand how the subject can be applied in novel and use-
ful ways. The Python code will give the novice readers a running start and will allow
them to gain quickly a hands-on appreciation of the subject. Destined to become a
classic in this rapidly burgeoning field.”
Prof. Riccardo Rebonato, EDHEC Business School. Former
Global Head of Rates and FX Analytics at PIMCO
“A tour de force on practical aspects of machine learning in finance, brimming with
ideas on how to employ cutting-edge techniques, such as fractional differentiation
and quantum computers, to gain insight and competitive advantage. A useful volume
for finance and machine learning practitioners alike.”
Dr. Collin P. Williams, Head of Research, D-Wave Systems

## Page 12

There are very few things which we know, which are not capable of
being reduced to a mathematical reasoning. And when they cannot,
it’s a sign our knowledge of them is very small and confused. Where a
mathematical reasoning can be had, it’s as great a folly to make use of
any other, as to grope for a thing in the dark, when you have a candle
standing by you.
—Of the Laws of Chance, Preface (1692)

About the Author
Marcos L´opez de Prado manages several multibillion-dollar funds for institutional
investors using machine learning algorithms. Over the past 20 years, his work has
combined advanced mathematics with supercomputing technologies to deliver bil-
lions of dollars in net profits for investors and firms. A proponent of research by
collaboration, Marcos has published with more than 30 leading academics, resulting
in some of the most-read papers in finance.
Since 2010, Marcos has also been a Research Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science), where he
conducts research focused on the mathematics of large-scale financial problems and
high-performance computing at the Computational Research department. For the past
seven years he has lectured at Cornell University, where he currently teaches a grad-
uate course in financial big data and machine learning in the Operations Research
department.
Marcos is the recipient of the 1999 National Award for Academic Excellence,
which the government of Spain bestows upon the best graduate student nationally.
He earned a PhD in financial economics (2003) and a second PhD in mathematical
finance (2011) from Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Between his two doctor-
ates, Marcos was a postdoctoral research fellow of RCC at Harvard University for
three years, during which he published more than a dozen articles in JCR-indexed
scientific journals. Marcos has an Erd´´os #2 and an Einstein #4, according to the Amer-
ican Mathematical Society.

CHAPTER 1
Financial Machine Learning as a
Distinct Subject
1.1
MOTIVATION
Machine learning (ML) is changing virtually every aspect of our lives. Today ML
algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently only expert humans could perform.
As it relates to finance, this is the most exciting time to adopt a disruptive technology
that will transform how everyone invests for generations. This book explains scien-
tifically sound ML tools that have worked for me over the course of two decades,
and have helped me to manage large pools of funds for some of the most demanding
institutional investors.
Books about investments largely fall in one of two categories. On one hand we
find books written by authors who have not practiced what they teach. They contain
extremely elegant mathematics that describes a world that does not exist. Just because
a theorem is true in a logical sense does not mean it is true in a physical sense. On the
other hand we find books written by authors who offer explanations absent of any
rigorous academic theory. They misuse mathematical tools to describe actual obser-
vations. Their models are overfit and fail when implemented. Academic investigation
and publication are divorced from practical application to financial markets, and
many applications in the trading/investment world are not grounded in proper science.
A first motivation for writing this book is to cross the proverbial divide that sepa-
rates academia and the industry. I have been on both sides of the rift, and I understand
how difficult it is to cross it and how easy it is to get entrenched on one side. Virtue is
in the balance. This book will not advocate a theory merely because of its mathemat-
ical beauty, and will not propose a solution just because it appears to work. My goal
is to transmit the kind of knowledge that only comes from experience, formalized in
a rigorous manner.

FINANCIAL MACHINE LEARNING AS A DISTINCT SUBJECT
A second motivation is inspired by the desire that finance serves a purpose. Over
the years some of my articles, published in academic journals and newspapers, have
expressed my displeasure with the current role that finance plays in our society.
Investors are lured to gamble their wealth on wild hunches originated by charlatans
and encouraged by mass media. One day in the near future, ML will dominate finance,
science will curtail guessing, and investing will not mean gambling. I would like the
reader to play a part in that revolution.
A third motivation is that many investors fail to grasp the complexity of ML appli-
cations to investments. This seems to be particularly true for discretionary firms mov-
ing into the “quantamental” space. I am afraid their high expectations will not be
met, not because ML failed, but because they used ML incorrectly. Over the com-
ing years, many firms will invest with off-the-shelf ML algorithms, directly imported
from academia or Silicon Valley, and my forecast is that they will lose money (to
better ML solutions). Beating the wisdom of the crowds is harder than recognizing
faces or driving cars. With this book my hope is that you will learn how to solve some
of the challenges that make finance a particularly difficult playground for ML, like
backtest overfitting. Financial ML is a subject in its own right, related to but separate
from standard ML, and this book unravels it for you.
1.2
THE MAIN REASON FINANCIAL MACHINE LEARNING
PROJECTS USUALLY FAIL
The rate of failure in quantitative finance is high, particularly so in financial ML. The
few who succeed amass a large amount of assets and deliver consistently exceptional
performance to their investors. However, that is a rare outcome, for reasons explained
in this book. Over the past two decades, I have seen many faces come and go, firms
started and shut down. In my experience, there is one critical mistake that underlies
all those failures.
1.2.1
The Sisyphus Paradigm
Discretionary portfolio managers (PMs) make investment decisions that do not fol-
low a particular theory or rationale (if there were one, they would be systematic PMs).
They consume raw news and analyses, but mostly rely on their judgment or intu-
ition. They may rationalize those decisions based on some story, but there is always
a story for every decision. Because nobody fully understands the logic behind their
bets, investment firms ask them to work independently from one another, in silos, to
ensure diversification. If you have ever attended a meeting of discretionary PMs, you
probably noticed how long and aimless they can be. Each attendee seems obsessed
about one particular piece of anecdotal information, and giant argumentative leaps
are made without fact-based, empirical evidence. This does not mean that discre-
tionary PMs cannot be successful. On the contrary, a few of them are. The point is,
they cannot naturally work as a team. Bring 50 discretionary PMs together, and they

## Page 32

THE MAIN REASON FINANCIAL MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS USUALLY FAIL
5
will influence one another until eventually you are paying 50 salaries for the work of
one. Thus it makes sense for them to work in silos so they interact as little as possible.
Wherever I have seen that formula applied to quantitative or ML projects, it has
led to disaster. The boardroom’s mentality is, let us do with quants what has worked
with discretionary PMs. Let us hire 50 PhDs and demand that each of them produce an
investment strategy within six months. This approach always backfires, because each
PhD will frantically search for investment opportunities and eventually settle for (1)
a false positive that looks great in an overfit backtest or (2) standard factor investing,
which is an overcrowded strategy with a low Sharpe ratio, but at least has academic
support. Both outcomes will disappoint the investment board, and the project will
be cancelled. Even if 5 of those PhDs identified a true discovery, the profits would
not suffice to cover for the expenses of 50, so those 5 will relocate somewhere else,
searching for a proper reward.
1.2.2
The Meta-Strategy Paradigm
If you have been asked to develop ML strategies on your own, the odds are stacked
against you. It takes almost as much effort to produce one true investment strategy
as to produce a hundred, and the complexities are overwhelming: data curation and
processing, HPC infrastructure, software development, feature analysis, execution
simulators, backtesting, etc. Even if the firm provides you with shared services in
those areas, you are like a worker at a BMW factory who has been asked to build an
entire car by using all the workshops around you. One week you need to be a master
welder, another week an electrician, another week a mechanical engineer, another
week a painter . . . You will try, fail, and circle back to welding. How does that
make sense?
Every successful quantitative firm I am aware of applies the meta-strategy
paradigm (L´opez de Prado [2014]). Accordingly, this book was written as a research
manual for teams, not for individuals. Through its chapters you will learn how to set
up a research factory, as well as the various stations of the assembly line. The role of
each quant is to specialize in a particular task, to become the best there is at it, while
having a holistic view of the entire process. This book outlines the factory plan,
where teamwork yields discoveries at a predictable rate, with no reliance on lucky
strikes. This is how Berkeley Lab and other U.S. National Laboratories routinely
make scientific discoveries, such as adding 16 elements to the periodic table, or
laying out the groundwork for MRIs and PET scans.1 No particular individual is
responsible for these discoveries, as they are the outcome of team efforts where
everyone contributes. Of course, setting up these financial laboratories takes time,
and requires people who know what they are doing and have done it before. But
what do you think has a higher chance of success, this proven paradigm of organized
collaboration or the Sisyphean alternative of having every single quant rolling their
immense boulder up the mountain?

BOOK STRUCTURE
This book disentangles a web of interconnected topics and presents them in an
ordered fashion. Each chapter assumes that you have read the previous ones. Part
1 will help you structure your financial data in a way that is amenable to ML algo-
rithms. Part 2 discusses how to do research with ML algorithms on that data. Here
the emphasis is on doing research and making an actual discovery through a scien-
tific process, as opposed to searching aimlessly until some serendipitous (likely false)
result pops up. Part 3 explains how to backtest your discovery and evaluate the prob-
ability that it is false.
These three parts give an overview of the entire process, from data analysis to
model research to discovery evaluation. With that knowledge, Part 4 goes back to the
data and explains innovative ways to extract informative features. Finally, much of
this work requires a lot of computational power, so Part 5 wraps up the book with
some useful HPC recipes.
1.3.1
Structure by Production Chain
Mining gold or silver was a relatively straightforward endeavor during the 16th and
17th centuries. In less than a hundred years, the Spanish treasure fleet quadrupled
the amount of precious metals in circulation throughout Europe. Those times are
long gone, and today prospectors must deploy complex industrial methods to extract
microscopic bullion particles out of tons of earth. That does not mean that gold
production is at historical lows. On the contrary, nowadays miners extract 2,500
metric tons of microscopic gold every year, compared to the average annual 1.54
metric tons taken by the Spanish conquistadors throughout the entire 16th century!2
Visible gold is an infinitesimal portion of the overall amount of gold on Earth. El
Dorado was always there . . . if only Pizarro could have exchanged the sword for a
microscope.
The discovery of investment strategies has undergone a similar evolution. If a
decade ago it was relatively common for an individual to discover macroscopic alpha
(i.e., using simple mathematical tools like econometrics), currently the chances of that
happening are quickly converging to zero. Individuals searching nowadays for macro-
scopic alpha, regardless of their experience or knowledge, are fighting overwhelming
odds. The only true alpha left is microscopic, and finding it requires capital-intensive
industrial methods. Just like with gold, microscopic alpha does not mean smaller
overall profits. Microscopic alpha today is much more abundant than macroscopic
alpha has ever been in history. There is a lot of money to be made, but you will need
to use heavy ML tools.
Let us review some of the stations involved in the chain of production within a
modern asset manager.

1.3.1.1
Data Curators
This is the station responsible for collecting, cleaning, indexing, storing, adjusting,
and delivering all data to the production chain. The values could be tabulated or
hierarchical, aligned or misaligned, historical or real-time feeds, etc. Team mem-
bers are experts in market microstructure and data protocols such as FIX. They must
develop the data handlers needed to understand the context in which that data arises.
For example, was a quote cancelled and replaced at a different level, or cancelled
without replacement? Each asset class has its own nuances. For instance, bonds are
routinely exchanged or recalled; stocks are subjected to splits, reverse-splits, voting
rights, etc.; futures and options must be rolled; currencies are not traded in a central-
ized order book. The degree of specialization involved in this station is beyond the
scope of this book, and Chapter 1 will discuss only a few aspects of data curation.
1.3.1.2
Feature Analysts
This is the station responsible for transforming raw data into informative signals.
These informative signals have some predictive power over financial variables. Team
members are experts in information theory, signal extraction and processing, visual-
ization, labeling, weighting, classifiers, and feature importance techniques. For exam-
ple, feature analysts may discover that the probability of a sell-off is particularly high
when: (1) quoted offers are cancelled-replaced with market sell orders, and (2) quoted
buy orders are cancelled-replaced with limit buy orders deeper in the book. Such a
finding is not an investment strategy on its own, and can be used in alternative ways:
execution, monitoring of liquidity risk, market making, position taking, etc. A com-
mon error is to believe that feature analysts develop strategies. Instead, feature ana-
lysts collect and catalogue libraries of findings that can be useful to a multiplicity of
stations. Chapters 2–9 and 17–19 are dedicated to this all-important station.
1.3.1.3
Strategists
In this station, informative features are transformed into actual investment algorithms.
A strategist will parse through the libraries of features looking for ideas to develop
an investment strategy. These features were discovered by different analysts studying
a wide range of instruments and asset classes. The goal of the strategist is to make
sense of all these observations and to formulate a general theory that explains them.
Therefore, the strategy is merely the experiment designed to test the validity of this
theory. Team members are data scientists with a deep knowledge of financial mar-
kets and the economy. Remember, the theory needs to explain a large collection of
important features. In particular, a theory must identify the economic mechanism that
causes an agent to lose money to us. Is it a behavioral bias? Asymmetric information?
Regulatory constraints? Features may be discovered by a black box, but the strategy
is developed in a white box. Gluing together a number of catalogued features does not
constitute a theory. Once a strategy is finalized, the strategists will prepare code that
utilizes the full algorithm and submit that prototype to the backtesting team described
below. Chapters 10 and 16 are dedicated to this station, with the understanding that
it would be unreasonable for a book to reveal specific investment strategies.

1.3.1.4
Backtesters
This station assesses the profitability of an investment strategy under various sce-
narios. One of the scenarios of interest is how the strategy would perform if history
repeated itself. However, the historical path is merely one of the possible outcomes of
a stochastic process, and not necessarily the most likely going forward. Alternative
scenarios must be evaluated, consistent with the knowledge of the weaknesses and
strengths of a proposed strategy. Team members are data scientists with a deep under-
standing of empirical and experimental techniques. A good backtester incorporates
in his analysis meta-information regarding how the strategy came about. In partic-
ular, his analysis must evaluate the probability of backtest overfitting by taking into
account the number of trials it took to distill the strategy. The results of this evaluation
will not be reused by other stations, for reasons that will become apparent in Chapter
11. Instead, backtest results are communicated to management and not shared with
anyone else. Chapters 11–16 discuss the analyses carried out by this station.
1.3.1.5
Deployment Team
The deployment team is tasked with integrating the strategy code into the production
line. Some components may be reused by multiple strategies, especially when they
share common features. Team members are algorithm specialists and hardcore
mathematical programmers. Part of their job is to ensure that the deployed solution
is logically identical to the prototype they received. It is also the deployment team’s
responsibility to optimize the implementation sufficiently, such that production
latency is minimized. As production calculations often are time sensitive, this team
will rely heavily on process schedulers, automation servers (Jenkins), vectoriza-
tion, multithreading, multiprocessing, graphics processing unit (GPU-NVIDIA),
distributed computing (Hadoop), high-performance computing (Slurm), and par-
allel computing techniques in general. Chapters 20–22 touch on various aspects
interesting to this station, as they relate to financial ML.
1.3.1.6
Portfolio Oversight
Once a strategy is deployed, it follows a cursus honorum, which entails the following
stages or lifecycle:
1. Embargo: Initially, the strategy is run on data observed after the end date of the
backtest. Such a period may have been reserved by the backtesters, or it may
be the result of implementation delays. If embargoed performance is consistent
with backtest results, the strategy is promoted to the next stage.
2. Paper trading: At this point, the strategy is run on a live, real-time feed. In this
way, performance will account for data parsing latencies, calculation latencies,
execution delays, and other time lapses between observation and positioning.
Paper trading will take place for as long as it is needed to gather enough evi-
dence that the strategy performs as expected.
3. Graduation: At this stage, the strategy manages a real position, whether in iso-
lation or as part of an ensemble. Performance is evaluated precisely, including
attributed risk, returns, and costs.

4. Re-allocation: Based on the production performance, the allocation to gradu-
ated strategies is re-assessed frequently and automatically in the context of a
diversified portfolio. In general, a strategy’s allocation follows a concave func-
tion. The initial allocation (at graduation) is small. As time passes, and the strat-
egy performs as expected, the allocation is increased. Over time, performance
decays, and allocations become gradually smaller.
5. Decommission: Eventually, all strategies are discontinued. This happens when
they perform below expectations for a sufficiently extended period of time to
conclude that the supporting theory is no longer backed by empirical evidence.
In general, it is preferable to release new variations of a strategy and run them in
parallel with old versions. Each version will go through the above lifecycle, and old
strategies will receive smaller allocations as a matter of diversification, while taking
into account the degree of confidence derived from their longer track record.
1.3.2
Structure by Strategy Component
Many investment managers believe that the secret to riches is to implement an
extremely complex ML algorithm. They are setting themselves up for a disappoint-
ment. If it was as easy as coding a state-of-the art classifier, most people in Silicon
Valley would be billionaires. A successful investment strategy is the result of mul-
tiple factors. Table 1.1 summarizes what chapters will help you address each of the
challenges involved in developing a successful investment strategy.
Throughout the book, you will find many references to journal articles I have
published over the years. Rather than repeating myself, I will often refer you to
one of them, where you will find a detailed analysis of the subject at hand. All of
my cited papers can be downloaded for free, in pre-print format, from my website:

petitors tapping the same well.

r How:
◦Chapters 2–22: Throughout the book, for each chapter, we develop our own
functions. For your particular problems, you will have to do the same, fol-
lowing the examples in the book.
1.3.2.3
Hardware
r Problem: ML involves some of the most computationally intensive tasks in all
of mathematics.
r Solution: Become an HPC expert. If possible, partner with a National Labora-
tory to build a supercomputer.
r How:
◦Chapters 20 and 22: Learn how to think in terms of multiprocessing architec-
tures. Whenever you code a library, structure it in such a way that functions
can be called in parallel. You will find plenty of examples in the book.
◦Chapter 21: Develop algorithms for quantum computers.
1.3.2.4
Math
r Problem: Mathematical proofs can take years, decades, and centuries. No
investor will wait that long.

## Page 38

r Solution: Use experimental math. Solve hard, intractable problems, not by proof
but by experiment. For example, Bailey, Borwein, and Plouffe [1997] found a
spigot algorithm for 𝜋(pi) without proof, against the prior perception that such
mathematical finding would not be possible.
r How:
◦Chapter 5: Familiarize yourself with memory-preserving data transforma-
tions.
◦Chapters 11–15: There are experimental methods to assess the value of your
strategy, with greater reliability than a historical simulation.
◦Chapter 16: An algorithm that is optimal in-sample can perform poorly out-
of-sample. There is no mathematical proof for investment success. Rely on
experimental methods to lead your research.
◦Chapters 17 and 18: Apply methods to detect structural breaks, and quantify
the amount of information carried by financial series.
◦Chapter 20: Learn queuing methods for distributed computing so that you
can break apart complex tasks and speed up calculations.
◦Chapter 21: Become familiar with discrete methods, used among others by
quantum computers, to solve intractable problems.
1.3.2.5
Meta-Strategies
r Problem: Amateurs develop individual strategies, believing that there is such a
thing as a magical formula for riches. In contrast, professionals develop meth-
ods to mass-produce strategies. The money is not in making a car, it is in making
a car factory.
r Solution: Think like a business. Your goal is to run a research lab like a factory,
where true discoveries are not born out of inspiration, but out of methodic hard
work. That was the philosophy of physicist Ernest Lawrence, the founder of the
first U.S. National Laboratory.
r How:
◦Chapters 7–9: Build a research process that identifies features relevant
across asset classes, while dealing with multi-collinearity of financial
features.
◦Chapter 10: Combine multiple predictions into a single bet.
◦Chapter 16: Allocate funds to strategies using a robust method that performs
well out-of-sample.
1.3.2.6
Overfitting
r Problem: Standard cross-validation methods fail in finance. Most discoveries in
finance are false, due to multiple testing and selection bias.
r Solution:
◦Whatever you do, always ask yourself in what way you may be overfitting. Be
skeptical about your own work, and constantly challenge yourself to prove
that you are adding value.

## Page 39

◦Overfitting is unethical. It leads to promising outcomes that cannot be deliv-
ered. When done knowingly, overfitting is outright scientific fraud. The fact
that many academics do it does not make it right: They are not risking any-
one’s wealth, not even theirs.
◦It is also a waste of your time, resources, and opportunities. Besides, the
industry only pays for out-of-sample returns. You will only succeed after
you have created substantial wealth for your investors.
r How:
◦Chapters 11–15: There are three backtesting paradigms, of which historical
simulation is only one. Each backtest is always overfit to some extent, and it
is critical to learn to quantify by how much.
◦Chapter 16: Learn robust techniques for asset allocation that do not overfit
in-sample signals at the expense of out-of-sample performance.
1.3.3
Structure by Common Pitfall
Despite its many advantages, ML is no panacea. The flexibility and power of ML
techniques have a dark side. When misused, ML algorithms will confuse statisti-
cal flukes with patterns. This fact, combined with the low signal-to-noise ratio that
characterizes finance, all but ensures that careless users will produce false discov-
eries at an ever-greater speed. This book exposes some of the most pervasive errors
made by ML experts when they apply their techniques on financial datasets. Some of
these pitfalls are listed in Table 1.2, with solutions that are explained in the indicated
chapters.
1.4
TARGET AUDIENCE
This book presents advanced ML methods specifically designed to address the chal-
lenges posed by financial datasets. By “advanced” I do not mean extremely difficult to
grasp, or explaining the latest reincarnation of deep, recurrent, or convolutional neu-
ral networks. Instead, the book answers questions that senior researchers, who have
experience applying ML algorithms to financial problems, will recognize as critical.
If you are new to ML, and you do not have experience working with complex algo-
rithms, this book may not be for you (yet). Unless you have confronted in practice the
problems discussed in these chapters, you may have difficulty understanding the util-
ity of solving them. Before reading this book, you may want to study several excellent
introductory ML books published in recent years. I have listed a few of them in the
references section.
The core audience of this book is investment professionals with a strong ML back-
ground. My goals are that you monetize what you learn in this book, help us mod-
ernize finance, and deliver actual value for investors.
This book also targets data scientists who have successfully implemented ML
algorithms in a variety of fields outside finance. If you have worked at Google and
have applied deep neural networks to face recognition, but things do not seem to

work so well when you run your algorithms on financial data, this book will help
you. Sometimes you may not understand the financial rationale behind some struc-
tures (e.g., meta-labeling, the triple-barrier method, fracdiff), but bear with me: Once
you have managed an investment portfolio long enough, the rules of the game will
become clearer to you, along with the meaning of these chapters.
1.5
REQUISITES
Investment management is one of the most multi-disciplinary areas of research, and
this book reflects that fact. Understanding the various sections requires a practical
knowledge of ML, market microstructure, portfolio management, mathematical
finance, statistics, econometrics, linear algebra, convex optimization, discrete
math, signal processing, information theory, object-oriented programming, parallel
processing, and supercomputing.
Python has become the de facto standard language for ML, and I have to assume
that you are an experienced developer. You must be familiar with scikit-learn
(sklearn), pandas, numpy, scipy, multiprocessing, matplotlib and a few other libraries.

Code snippets invoke functions from these libraries using their conventional prefix,
pd for pandas, np for numpy, mpl for matplotlib, etc. There are numerous books on
each of these libraries, and you cannot know enough about the specifics of each one.
Throughout the book we will discuss some issues with their implementation, includ-
ing unresolved bugs to keep in mind.
1.6
FAQs
How can ML algorithms be useful in finance?
Many financial operations require making decisions based on pre-defined rules, like
option pricing, algorithmic execution, or risk monitoring. This is where the bulk of
automation has taken place so far, transforming the financial markets into ultra-fast,
hyper-connected networks for exchanging information. In performing these tasks,
machines were asked to follow the rules as fast as possible. High-frequency trading
is a prime example. See Easley, L´opez de Prado, and O’Hara [2013] for a detailed
treatment of the subject.
The algorithmization of finance is unstoppable. Between June 12, 1968, and
December 31, 1968, the NYSE was closed every Wednesday, so that back office could
catch up with paperwork. Can you imagine that? We live in a different world today,
and in 10 years things will be even better. Because the next wave of automation does
not involve following rules, but making judgment calls. As emotional beings, subject
to fears, hopes, and agendas, humans are not particularly good at making fact-based
decisions, particularly when those decisions involve conflicts of interest. In those sit-
uations, investors are better served when a machine makes the calls, based on facts
learned from hard data. This not only applies to investment strategy development, but
to virtually every area of financial advice: granting a loan, rating a bond, classifying
a company, recruiting talent, predicting earnings, forecasting inflation, etc. Further-
more, machines will comply with the law, always, when programmed to do so. If a
dubious decision is made, investors can go back to the logs and understand exactly
what happened. It is much easier to improve an algorithmic investment process than
one relying entirely on humans.
How can ML algorithms beat humans at investing?
Do you remember when people were certain that computers would never beat humans
at chess? Or Jeopardy!? Poker? Go? Millions of years of evolution (a genetic algo-
rithm) have fine-tuned our ape brains to survive in a hostile 3-dimensional world
where the laws of nature are static. Now, when it comes to identifying subtle patterns
in a high-dimensional world, where the rules of the game change every day, all
that fine-tuning turns out to be detrimental. An ML algorithm can spot patterns in a
100-dimensional world as easily as in our familiar 3-dimensional one. And while we
all laugh when we see an algorithm make a silly mistake, keep in mind, algorithms
have been around only a fraction of our millions of years. Every day they get better
at this, we do not. Humans are slow learners, which puts us at a disadvantage in a
fast-changing world like finance.

Does that mean that there is no space left for human investors?
Not at all. No human is better at chess than a computer. And no computer is better
at chess than a human supported by a computer. Discretionary PMs are at a disad-
vantage when betting against an ML algorithm, but it is possible that the best results
are achieved by combining discretionary PMs with ML algorithms. This is what has
come to be known as the “quantamental” way. Throughout the book you will find
techniques that can be used by quantamental teams, that is, methods that allow you
to combine human guesses (inspired by fundamental variables) with mathematical
forecasts. In particular, Chapter 3 introduces a new technique called meta-labeling,
which allows you to add an ML layer on top of a discretionary one.
How does financial ML differ from econometrics?
Econometrics is the application of classical statistical methods to economic and finan-
cial series. The essential tool of econometrics is multivariate linear regression, an
18th-century technology that was already mastered by Gauss before 1794 (Stigler
[1981]). Standard econometric models do not learn. It is hard to believe that some-
thing as complex as 21st-century finance could be grasped by something as simple
as inverting a covariance matrix.
Every empirical science must build theories based on observation. If the statistical
toolbox used to model these observations is linear regression, the researcher will fail
to recognize the complexity of the data, and the theories will be awfully simplistic,
useless. I have no doubt in my mind, econometrics is a primary reason economics
and finance have not experienced meaningful progress over the past 70 years (Calkin
and L´opez de Prado [2014a, 2014b]).
For centuries, medieval astronomers made observations and developed theo-
ries about celestial mechanics. These theories never considered non-circular orbits,
because they were deemed unholy and beneath God’s plan. The prediction errors were
so gross, that ever more complex theories had to be devised to account for them. It was
not until Kepler had the temerity to consider non-circular (elliptical) orbits that all of
the sudden a much simpler general model was able to predict the position of the plan-
ets with astonishing accuracy. What if astronomers had never considered non-circular
orbits? Well . . . what if economists finally started to consider non-linear functions?
Where is our Kepler? Finance does not have a Principia because no Kepler means no
Newton.
Financial ML methods do not replace theory. They guide it. An ML algorithm
learns patterns in a high-dimensional space without being specifically directed. Once
we understand what features are predictive of a phenomenon, we can build a theo-
retical explanation, which can be tested on an independent dataset. Students of eco-
nomics and finance would do well enrolling in ML courses, rather than econometrics.
Econometrics may be good enough to succeed in financial academia (for now), but
succeeding in business requires ML.
What do you say to people who dismiss ML algorithms as black boxes?
If you are reading this book, chances are ML algorithms are white boxes to you.
They are transparent, well-defined, crystal-clear, pattern-recognition functions. Most

people do not have your knowledge, and to them ML is like a magician’s box: “Where
did that rabbit come from? How are you tricking us, witch?” People mistrust what they
do not understand. Their prejudices are rooted in ignorance, for which the Socratic
remedy is simple: education. Besides, some of us enjoy using our brains, even though
neuroscientists still have not figured out exactly how they work (a black box in itself).
From time to time you will encounter Luddites, who are beyond redemption. Ned
Ludd was a weaver from Leicester, England, who in 1779 smashed two knitting
frames in an outrage. With the advent of the industrial revolution, mobs infuriated by
mechanization sabotaged and destroyed all machinery they could find. Textile work-
ers ruined so much industrial equipment that Parliament had to pass laws making
“machine breaking” a capital crime. Between 1811 and 1816, large parts of Eng-
land were in open rebellion, to the point that there were more British troops fighting
Luddites than there were fighting Napoleon on the Iberian Peninsula. The Luddite
rebellion ended with brutal suppression through military force. Let us hope that the
black box movement does not come to that.
Why don’t you discuss specific ML algorithms?
The book is agnostic with regards to the particular ML algorithm you choose.
Whether you use convolutional neural networks, AdaBoost, RFs, SVMs, and so on,
there are many shared generic problems you will face: data structuring, label-
ing, weighting, stationary transformations, cross-validation, feature selection, fea-
ture importance, overfitting, backtesting, etc. In the context of financial modeling,
answering these questions is non-trivial, and framework-specific approaches need to
be developed. That is the focus of this book.
What other books do you recommend on this subject?
To my knowledge, this is the first book to provide a complete and systematic treatment
of ML methods specific for finance: starting with a chapter dedicated to financial data
structures, another chapter for labeling of financial series, another for sample weight-
ing, time series differentiation, . . . all the way to a full part devoted to the proper back-
testing of investment strategies. To be sure, there are a handful of prior publications
(mostly journal articles) that have applied standard ML to financial series, but that
is not what this book offers. My goal has been to address the unique nuisances that
make financial ML modeling particularly challenging. Like any new subject, it is fast
evolving, and the book will be updated as major advances take place. Please contact
me at mldp@quantresearch.org if there is any particular topic you would like to see
treated in future editions. I will gladly add those chapters, while acknowledging the
names of those readers who suggested them.
I do not understand some of the sections and chapters. What should I do?
My advice is that you start by reading the references listed at the end of the chapter.
When I wrote the book, I had to assume the reader was familiar with the existing
literature, or this book would lose its focus. If after reading those references the sec-
tions still do not make sense, the likely reason is that they are related to a problem
well understood by investment professionals (even if there is no mention of it in the

## Page 44

FAQs
17
literature). For example, Chapter 2 will discuss effective methods to adjust futures
prices for the roll, a problem known to most practitioners, even though it is rarely
addressed in textbooks. I would encourage you to attend one of my regular seminars,
and ask me your question at the end of my talk.
Why is the book so fixated on backtest overfitting?
There are two reasons. First, backtest overfitting is arguably the most important open
problem in all of mathematical finance. It is our equivalent to “P versus NP” in com-
puter science. If there was a precise method to prevent backtest overfitting, we would
be able to take backtests to the bank. A backtest would be almost as good as cash,
rather than a sales pitch. Hedge funds would allocate funds to portfolio managers
with confidence. Investors would risk less, and would be willing to pay higher fees.
Regulators would grant licenses to hedge fund managers on the basis of reliable evi-
dence of skill and knowledge, leaving no space for charlatans. In my opinion, an
investments book that does not address this issue is not worth your time. Why would
you read a book that deals with CAPM, APT, asset allocation techniques, risk man-
agement, etc. when the empirical results that support those arguments were selected
without determining their false discovery probabilities?
The second reason is that ML is a great weapon in your research arsenal, and a
dangerous one to be sure. If backtest overfitting is an issue in econometric analysis,
the flexibility of ML makes it a constant threat to your work. This is particularly the
case in finance, because our datasets are shorter, with lower signal-to-noise ratio, and
we do not have laboratories where we can conduct experiments while controlling
for all environmental variables (L´opez de Prado [2015]). An ML book that does not
tackle these concerns can be more detrimental than beneficial to your career.
What is the mathematical nomenclature of the book?
When I started to write this book, I thought about assigning one symbol to each math-
ematical variable or function through all the chapters. That would work well if this
book dealt with a single subject, like stochastic optimal control. However this book
deals with a wide range of mathematical subjects, each with its own conventions.
Readers would find it harder to consult references unless I also followed literature
standards, which means that sometimes we must re-use symbols. To prevent any
confusion, every chapter explains the nomenclature as it is being used. Most of the
math is accompanied by a code snippet, so in case of doubt, please always follow
the code.
Who wrote Chapter 22?
A popular perception is that ML is a new fascinating technology invented or perfected
at IBM, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, etc. It is true that technology firms
have become heavy users of ML, especially in recent years. Those firms sponsored
some of the most publicized recent ML achievements (like Jeopardy! or Go), which
may have reinforced that perception.
However, the reader may be surprised to learn that, in fact, U.S. National Labo-
ratories are among the research centers with the longest track record and experience

## Page 45

in using ML. These centers utilized ML before it was cool, and they applied it suc-
cessfully for many decades to produce astounding scientific discoveries. If predicting
what movies Netflix should recommend you to watch next is a worthy endeavor, so it
is to understand the rate of expansion of the universe, or forecasting what coastlines
will be most impacted by global warming, or preventing a cataclysmic failure of our
national power grid. These are just some of the amazing questions that institutions
like Berkeley Lab work on every day, quietly but tirelessly, with the help of ML.
In Chapter 22, Drs. Horst Simon and Kesheng Wu offer the perspective of a deputy
director and a project leader at a major U.S. National Laboratory specializing in large-
scale scientific research involving big data, high-performance computing, and ML.
Unlike traditional university settings, National Laboratories achieve scientific break-
throughs by putting together interdisciplinary teams that follow well-devised proce-
dures, with strong division of labor and responsibilities. That kind of research model
by production chain was born at Berkeley Lab almost 90 years ago and inspired the
meta-strategy paradigm explained in Sections 1.2.2 and 1.3.1.

latest count, these works were co-authored with more than 30 leading experts in this
field, including Prof. David H. Bailey (15 articles), Prof. David Easley (8 articles),
Prof. Maureen O’Hara (8 articles), and Prof. Jonathan M. Borwein (6 articles). This
book is to a great extent also theirs, for it would not have been possible without their

(a) Have they succeeded?
(b) What are the cultural difficulties involved in this transition?
1.2 What is the most important open problem in mathematical finance? If this prob-
lem was resolved, how could:
(a) regulators use it to grant investment management licenses?
(b) investors use it to allocate funds?
(c) firms use it to reward researchers?
1.3 According to Institutional Investor, only 17% of hedge fund assets are managed
by quantitative firms. That is about $500 billion allocated in total across all
quantitative funds as of June 2017, compared to $386 billion a year earlier.
What do you think is driving this massive reallocation of assets?
1.4 According to Institutional Investor’s Rich List, how many quantitative invest-

1.5 What is the key difference between econometric methods and ML? How would
economics and finance benefit from updating their statistical toolkit?
1.6 Science has a very minimal understanding of how the human brain (or any brain)

causes critics of financial ML to disregard it as a black box, while embracing
discretionary investing?
1.7 You read a journal article that describes an investment strategy. In a backtest, it
achieves an annualized Sharpe ratio in excess of 2, with a confidence level of

algorithm did what it was programmed to do, and the investor agreed to the
terms of the program, as verified by forensic examination of the computer
logs. In what sense is this situation better for the investor, compared to a
loss caused by a discretionary PM’s poor judgment? What is the investor’s
recourse in each instance?

CHAPTER 2
Financial Data Structures
2.1
MOTIVATION
In this chapter we will learn how to work with unstructured financial data, and from
that to derive a structured dataset amenable to ML algorithms. In general, you do not
want to consume someone else’s processed dataset, as the likely outcome will be that
you discover what someone else already knows or will figure out soon. Ideally your
starting point is a collection of unstructured, raw data that you are going to process
in a way that will lead to informative features.
2.2
ESSENTIAL TYPES OF FINANCIAL DATA
Financial data comes in many shapes and forms. Table 2.1 shows the four essential
types of financial data, ordered from left to right in terms of increasing diversity. Next,
we will discuss their different natures and applications.
2.2.1
Fundamental Data
Fundamental data encompasses information that can be found in regulatory filings
and business analytics. It is mostly accounting data, reported quarterly. A particular
aspect of this data is that it is reported with a lapse. You must confirm exactly when
each data point was released, so that your analysis uses that information only after
it was publicly available. A common beginner’s error is to assume that this data was
published at the end of the reporting period. That is never the case.
For example, fundamental data published by Bloomberg is indexed by the last date
included in the report, which precedes the date of the release (often by 1.5 months). In
other words, Bloomberg is assigning those values to a date when they were not known.
You could not believe how many papers are published every year using misaligned

fundamental data, especially in the factor-investing literature. Once you align the data
correctly, a substantial number of findings in those papers cannot be reproduced.
A second aspect of fundamental data is that it is often backfilled or reinstated.
“Backfilling” means that missing data is assigned a value, even if those values were
unknown at that time. A “reinstated value” is a corrected value that amends an incor-
rect initial release. A company may issue multiple corrections for a past quarter’s
results long after the first publication, and data vendors may overwrite the initial val-
ues with their corrections. The problem is, the corrected values were not known on
that first release date. Some data vendors circumvent this problem by storing multiple
release dates and values for each variable. For example, we typically have three val-
ues for a single quarterly GDP release: the original released value and two monthly
revisions. Still, it is very common to find studies that use the final released value and
assign it to the time of the first release, or even to the last day in the reporting period.
We will revisit this mistake, and its implications, when we discuss backtesting errors
in Chapter 11.
Fundamental data is extremely regularized and low frequency. Being so accessible
to the marketplace, it is rather unlikely that there is much value left to be exploited.
Still, it may be useful in combination with other data types.
2.2.2
Market Data
Market data includes all trading activity that takes place in an exchange (like CME)
or trading venue (like MarketAxess). Ideally, your data provider has given you a raw
feed, with all sorts of unstructured information, like FIX messages that allow you
to fully reconstruct the trading book, or the full collection of BWIC (bids wanted
in competition) responses. Every market participant leaves a characteristic footprint
in the trading records, and with enough patience, you will find a way to anticipate
a competitor’s next move. For example, TWAP algorithms leave a very particular
footprint that is used by predatory algorithms to front-run their end-of-day trading
(usually hedging) activity (Easley, L´opez de Prado, and O’Hara [2011]). Human
GUI traders often trade in round lots, and you can use this fact to estimate what
percentage of the volume is coming from them at a given point in time, then associate
it with a particular market behavior.

## Page 52

BARS
25
One appealing aspect of FIX data is that it is not trivial to process, unlike fun-
damental data. It is also very abundant, with over 10 TB being generated on a daily
basis. That makes it a more interesting dataset for strategy research.
2.2.3
Analytics
You could think of analytics as derivative data, based on an original source, which
could be fundamental, market, alternative, or even a collection of other analytics.
What characterizes analytics is not the content of the information, but that it is not
readily available from an original source, and that it has been processed for you in
a particular way. Investment banks and research firms sell valuable information that
results from in-depth analyses of companies’ business models, activities, competition,
outlook, etc. Some specialized firms sell statistics derived from alternative data, for
example, the sentiment extracted from news reports and social media.
A positive aspect of analytics is that the signal has been extracted for you from a
raw source. The negative aspects are that analytics may be costly, the methodology
used in their production may be biased or opaque, and you will not be the sole
consumer.
2.2.4
Alternative Data
Kolanovic and Krishnamachari [2017] differentiate among alternative data produced
by individuals (social media, news, web searches, etc.), business processes (transac-
tions, corporate data, government agencies, etc.), and sensors (satellites, geolocation,
weather, CCTV, etc.). Some popular satellite image or video feeds include monitoring
of tankers, tunnel traffic activity, or parking lot occupancies.
What truly characterizes alternative data is that it is primary information, that is,
information that has not made it to the other sources. Before Exxon Mobile reported
increased earnings, before its market price shot up, before analysts wrote their com-
mentary of their latest filings, before all of that, there were movements of tankers
and drillers and pipeline traffic. They happened months before those activities were
reflected in the other data types. Two problematic aspects of alternative data are their
cost and privacy concerns. All that spy craft is expensive, and the surveilled company
may object, not to mention bystanders.
Alternative data offers the opportunity to work with truly unique, hard-to-process
datasets. Remember, data that is hard to store, manipulate, and operate is always the
most promising. You will recognize that a dataset may be useful if it annoys your data
infrastructure team. Perhaps your competitors did not try to use it for logistic reasons,
gave up midway, or processed it incorrectly.
2.3
BARS
In order to apply ML algorithms on your unstructured data, we need to parse it,
extract valuable information from it, and store those extractions in a regularized
format. Most ML algorithms assume a table representation of the extracted data.

## Page 53

26
FINANCIAL DATA STRUCTURES
Finance practitioners often refer to those tables’ rows as “bars.” We can distinguish
between two categories of bar methods: (1) standard bar methods, which are
common in the literature, and (2) more advanced, information-driven methods,
which sophisticated practitioners use although they cannot be found (yet) in journal
articles. In this section, we will discuss how to form those bars.
2.3.1
Standard Bars
Some bar construction methods are very popular in the financial industry, to the point
that most data vendors’ APIs offer several of them. The purpose of these methods is
to transform a series of observations that arrive at irregular frequency (often referred
to as “inhomogeneous series”) into a homogeneous series derived from regular
sampling.
2.3.1.1
Time Bars
Time bars are obtained by sampling information at fixed time intervals, e.g., once
every minute. The information collected usually includes:
r Timestamp
r Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
r Open (i.e., first) price
r Close (i.e., last) price
r High price
r Low price
r Volume traded, etc.
Although time bars are perhaps the most popular among practitioners and aca-
demics, they should be avoided for two reasons. First, markets do not process infor-
mation at a constant time interval. The hour following the open is much more active
than the hour around noon (or the hour around midnight in the case of futures). As
biological beings, it makes sense for humans to organize their day according to the
sunlight cycle. But today’s markets are operated by algorithms that trade with loose
human supervision, for which CPU processing cycles are much more relevant than
chronological intervals (Easley, L´opez de Prado, and O’Hara [2011]). This means that
time bars oversample information during low-activity periods and undersample infor-
mation during high-activity periods. Second, time-sampled series often exhibit poor
statistical properties, like serial correlation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality of
returns (Easley, L´opez de Prado, and O’Hara [2012]). GARCH models were devel-
oped, in part, to deal with the heteroscedasticity associated with incorrect sampling.
As we will see next, forming bars as a subordinated process of trading activity avoids
this problem in the first place.
2.3.1.2
Tick Bars
The idea behind tick bars is straightforward: The sample variables listed earlier
(timestamp, VWAP, open price, etc.) will be extracted each time a pre-defined number

## Page 54

BARS
27
of transactions takes place, e.g., 1,000 ticks. This allows us to synchronize sampling
with a proxy of information arrival (the speed at which ticks are originated).
Mandelbrot and Taylor [1967] were among the first to realize that sampling as a
function of the number of transactions exhibited desirable statistical properties: “Price
changes over a fixed number of transactions may have a Gaussian distribution. Price
changes over a fixed time period may follow a stable Paretian distribution, whose
variance is infinite. Since the number of transactions in any time period is random,
the above statements are not necessarily in disagreement.”
Ever since Mandelbrot and Taylor’s paper, multiple studies have confirmed that
sampling as a function of trading activity allows us to achieve returns closer to IID
Normal (see An´e and Geman [2000]). This is important, because many statistical
methods rely on the assumption that observations are drawn from an IID Gaussian
process. Intuitively, we can only draw inference from a random variable that is invari-
ant, and tick bars allow for better inference than time bars.
When constructing tick bars, you need to be aware of outliers. Many exchanges
carry out an auction at the open and an auction at the close. This means that for a
period of time, the order book accumulates bids and offers without matching them.
When the auction concludes, a large trade is published at the clearing price, for an
outsized amount. This auction trade could be the equivalent of thousands of ticks,
even though it is reported as one tick.
2.3.1.3
Volume Bars
One problem with tick bars is that order fragmentation introduces some arbitrariness
in the number of ticks. For example, suppose that there is one order sitting on the
offer, for a size of 10. If we buy 10 lots, our one order will be recorded as one tick.
If instead on the offer there are 10 orders of size 1, our one buy will be recorded as
10 separate transactions. In addition, matching engine protocols can further split one
fill into multiple artificial partial fills, as a matter of operational convenience.
Volume bars circumvent that problem by sampling every time a pre-defined
amount of the security’s units (shares, futures contracts, etc.) have been exchanged.
For example, we could sample prices every time a futures contract exchanges 1,000
units, regardless of the number of ticks involved.
It is hard to imagine these days, but back in the 1960s vendors rarely published
volume data, as customers were mostly concerned with tick prices. After volume
started to be reported as well, Clark [1973] realized that sampling returns by volume
achieved even better statistical properties (i.e., closer to an IID Gaussian distribution)
than sampling by tick bars. Another reason to prefer volume bars over time bars or
tick bars is that several market microstructure theories study the interaction between
prices and volume. Sampling as a function of one of these variables is a convenient
artifact for these analyses, as we will find out in Chapter 19.
2.3.1.4
Dollar Bars
Dollar bars are formed by sampling an observation every time a pre-defined mar-
ket value is exchanged. Of course, the reference to dollars is meant to apply to the

## Page 55

currency in which the security is denominated, but nobody refers to euro bars, pound
bars, or yen bars (although gold bars would make for a fun pun).
Let me illustrate the rationale behind dollar bars with a couple of examples. First,
suppose that we wish to analyze a stock that has exhibited an appreciation of 100%
over a certain period of time. Selling $1,000 worth of that stock at the end of the
period requires trading half the number of shares it took to buy $1,000 worth of that
stock at the beginning. In other words, the number of shares traded is a function
of the actual value exchanged. Therefore, it makes sense sampling bars in terms of
dollar value exchanged, rather than ticks or volume, particularly when the analysis
involves significant price fluctuations. This point can be verified empirically. If you
compute tick bars and volume bars on E-mini S&P 500 futures for a given bar size,
the number of bars per day will vary wildly over the years. That range and speed
of variation will be reduced once you compute the number of dollar bars per day
over the years, for a constant bar size. Figure 2.1 plots the exponentially weighted
average number of bars per day when we apply a fixed bar size on tick, volume,
and dollar sampling methods.
A second argument that makes dollar bars more interesting than time, tick, or
volume bars is that the number of outstanding shares often changes multiple times
over the course of a security’s life, as a result of corporate actions. Even after adjusting
for splits and reverse splits, there are other actions that will impact the amount of ticks
and volumes, like issuing new shares or buying back existing shares (a very common
practice since the Great Recession of 2008). Dollar bars tend to be robust in the face
of those actions. Still, you may want to sample dollar bars where the size of the bar is
not kept constant over time. Instead, the bar size could be adjusted dynamically as a
function of the free-floating market capitalization of a company (in the case of stocks),
or the outstanding amount of issued debt (in the case of fixed-income securities).

Information-Driven Bars
The purpose of information-driven bars is to sample more frequently when new infor-
mation arrives to the market. In this context, the word “information” is used in a mar-
ket microstructural sense. As we will see in Chapter 19, market microstructure the-
ories confer special importance to the persistence of imbalanced signed volumes, as
that phenomenon is associated with the presence of informed traders. By synchroniz-
ing sampling with the arrival of informed traders, we may be able to make decisions
before prices reach a new equilibrium level. In this section we will explore how to
use various indices of information arrival to sample bars.
2.3.2.1
Tick Imbalance Bars
Consider a sequence of ticks {(pt, vt)}t=1,…,T, where pt is the price associated with
tick t and vt is the volume associated with tick t. The so-called tick rule defines a
sequence {bt}t=1,…,T where
bt =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
bt−1
if Δpt = 0
||Δpt||
Δpt
if Δpt ≠0
with bt ∈{−1, 1}, and the boundary condition b0 is set to match the terminal value bT
from the immediately preceding bar. The idea behind tick imbalance bars (TIBs) is to
sample bars whenever tick imbalances exceed our expectations. We wish to determine
the tick index, T, such that the accumulation of signed ticks (signed according to the
tick rule) exceeds a given threshold. Next, let us discuss the procedure to determine T.
First, we define the tick imbalance at time T as
𝜃T =
T
∑
t=1
bt
Second, we compute the expected value of 𝜃T at the beginning of the bar, E0[𝜃T] =
E0[T](P[bt = 1] −P[bt = −1]), where E0[T] is the expected size of the tick bar,
P[bt = 1] is the unconditional probability that a tick is classified as a buy, and
P[bt = −1] is the unconditional probability that a tick is classified as a sell. Since
P[bt = 1] + P[bt = −1] = 1, then E0[𝜃T] = E0[T](2P[bt = 1] −1). In practice, we
can estimate E0[T] as an exponentially weighted moving average of T values from
prior bars, and (2P[bt = 1] −1) as an exponentially weighted moving average of bt
values from prior bars.
Third, we define a tick imbalance bar (TIB) as a T∗-contiguous subset of ticks
such that the following condition is met:
T∗= arg min
T
{
||𝜃T|| ≥E0 [T] |||2P [bt = 1] −1|||
}

## Page 57

where the size of the expected imbalance is implied by |2P[bt = 1] −1|. When 𝜃T
is more imbalanced than expected, a low T will satisfy these conditions. Accord-
ingly, TIBs are produced more frequently under the presence of informed trading
(asymmetric information that triggers one-side trading). In fact, we can understand
TIBs as buckets of trades containing equal amounts of information (regardless of the
volumes, prices, or ticks traded).
2.3.2.2
Volume/Dollar Imbalance Bars
The idea behind volume imbalance bars (VIBs) and dollar imbalance bars (DIBs) is
to extend the concept of tick imbalance bars (TIBs). We would like to sample bars
when volume or dollar imbalances diverge from our expectations. Based on the same
notions of tick rule and boundary condition b0 as we discussed for TIBs, we will
define a procedure to determine the index of the next sample, T.
First, we define the imbalance at time T as
𝜃T =
T
∑
t=1
btvt
where vt may represent either the number of securities traded (VIB) or the dollar
amount exchanged (DIB). Your choice of vt is what determines whether you are sam-
pling according to the former or the latter.
Second, we compute the expected value of 𝜃T at the beginning of the bar
E0[𝜃T] = E0
[
T∑
t|bt=1
vt
]
−E0
[
T∑
t|bt=−1
vt
]
= E0[T](P[bt = 1]E0[vt|bt = 1]
−P[bt = −1]E0[vt|bt = −1])
Let us denote v+ = P[bt = 1]E0[vt|bt = 1], v−= P[bt = −1]E0[vt|bt = −1], so
that E0[T]−1E0[∑
t vt] = E0[vt] = v+ + v−. You can think of v+ and v−as decom-
posing the initial expectation of vt into the component contributed by buys and the
component contributed by sells. Then
E0[𝜃T] = E0[T](v+ −v−) = E0[T](2v+ −E0[vt])
In practice, we can estimate E0[T] as an exponentially weighted moving average
of T values from prior bars, and (2v+ −E0[vt]) as an exponentially weighted moving
average of btvt values from prior bars.
Third, we define VIB or DIB as a T∗-contiguous subset of ticks such that the
following condition is met:
T∗= arg min
T
{|𝜃T| ≥E0[T]|2v+ −E0[vt]|}

## Page 58

BARS
31
where the size of the expected imbalance is implied by |2v+ −E0[vt]|. When 𝜃T is
more imbalanced than expected, a low T will satisfy these conditions. This is the
information-based analogue of volume and dollar bars, and like its predecessors, it
addresses the same concerns regarding tick fragmentation and outliers. Furthermore,
it also addresses the issue of corporate actions, because the above procedure does
not rely on a constant bar size. Instead, the bar size is adjusted dynamically.
2.3.2.3
Tick Runs Bars
TIBs, VIBs, and DIBs monitor order flow imbalance, as measured in terms of ticks,
volumes, and dollar values exchanged. Large traders will sweep the order book, use
iceberg orders, or slice a parent order into multiple children, all of which leave a
trace of runs in the {bt}t=1,…,T sequence. For this reason, it can be useful to monitor
the sequence of buys in the overall volume, and take samples when that sequence
diverges from our expectations.
First, we define the length of the current run as
𝜃T = max
{
T
∑
t|bt=1
bt, −
T
∑
t|bt=−1
bt
}
Second, we compute the expected value of 𝜃T at the beginning of the bar
E0[𝜃T] = E0[T]max{P[bt = 1], 1 −P[bt = 1]}
In practice, we can estimate E0[T] as an exponentially weighted moving average of
T values from prior bars, and P[bt = 1] as an exponentially weighted moving average
of the proportion of buy ticks from prior bars.
Third, we define a tick runs bar (TRB) as a T∗-contiguous subset of ticks such that
the following condition is met:
T∗= arg min
T
{𝜃T ≥E0[T]max{P[bt = 1],1 −P[bt = 1]}}
where the expected count of ticks from runs is implied by max{P[bt = 1],
1 −P[bt = −1]}. When 𝜃T exhibits more runs than expected, a low T will satisfy
these conditions. Note that in this definition of runs we allow for sequence breaks.
That is, instead of measuring the length of the longest sequence, we count the number
of ticks of each side, without offsetting them (no imbalance). In the context of forming
bars, this turns out to be a more useful definition than measuring sequence lengths.
2.3.2.4
Volume/Dollar Runs Bars
Volume runs bars (VRBs) and dollar runs bars (DRBs) extend the above definition of
runs to volumes and dollars exchanged, respectively. The intuition is that we wish to
sample bars whenever the volumes or dollars traded by one side exceed our expec-
tation for a bar. Following our customary nomenclature for the tick rule, we need to
determine the index T of the last observation in the bar.

where vt may represent either number of securities traded (VRB) or dollar amount

Second, we compute the expected value of 𝜃T at the beginning of the bar,
E0[𝜃T] = E0[T]max{P[bt = 1]E0[vt|bt = 1], (1 −P[bt = 1])E0[vt|bt = −1]}
In practice, we can estimate E0[T] as an exponentially weighted moving average
of T values from prior bars, P[bt = 1] as an exponentially weighted moving aver-
age of the proportion of buy ticks from prior bars, E0[vt|bt = 1] as an exponentially
weighted moving average of the buy volumes from prior bars, and E0[vt|bt = −1] as
an exponentially weighted moving average of the sell volumes from prior bars.
Third, we define a volume runs bar (VRB) as a T∗-contiguous subset of ticks such
that the following condition is met:
T∗= arg min
T
{𝜃T ≥E0[T]max{P[bt = 1]E0[vt|bt = 1],
(1 −P[bt = 1])E0[vt|bt = −1]}}
where the expected volume from runs is implied by max{P[bt = 1]E0[vt|bt = 1],
(1 −P[bt = 1])E0[vt|bt = −1]}. When 𝜃T exhibits more runs than expected, or the
volume from runs is greater than expected, a low T will satisfy these conditions.

DEALING WITH MULTI-PRODUCT SERIES
Sometimes we are interested in modelling a time series of instruments, where the
weights need to be dynamically adjusted over time. Other times we must deal with
products that pay irregular coupons or dividends, or that are subject to corporate
actions. Events that alter the nature of the time series under study need to be treated
properly, or we will inadvertently introduce a structural break that will mislead our
research efforts (more on this in Chapter 17). This problem appears in many guises:
when we model spreads with changing weights, or baskets of securities where div-
idends/coupons must be reinvested, or baskets that must be rebalanced, or when an
index’s constituents are changed, or when we must replace an expired/matured con-
tract/security with another, etc.

Futures are a case in point. In my experience, people struggle unnecessarily when
manipulating futures, mainly because they do not know how to handle the roll well.
The same can be said of strategies based on spreads of futures, or baskets of stocks or
bonds. In the next section, I’ll show you one way to model a basket of securities as if
it was a single cash product. I call it the “ETF trick” because the goal is to transform
any complex multi-product dataset into a single dataset that resembles a total-return
ETF. Why is this useful? Because your code can always assume that you only trade
cashlike products (non-expiring cash instruments), regardless of the complexity and
composition of the underlying series.
2.4.1
The ETF Trick
Suppose we wish to develop a strategy that trades a spread of futures. A few nuisances
arise from dealing with a spread rather than an outright instrument. First, the spread
is characterized by a vector of weights that changes over time. As a result, the spread
itself may converge even if prices do not change. When that happens, a model trading
that series will be misled to believe that PnL (the net mark-to-market value of profits
and losses) has resulted from that weight-induced convergence. Second, spreads can
acquire negative values, because they do not represent a price. This can often be
problematic, as most models assume positive prices. Third, trading times will not
align exactly for all constituents, so the spread is not always tradeable at the last
levels published, or with zero latency risk. Also, execution costs must be considered,
like crossing the bid-ask spread.
One way to avoid these issues is to produce a time series that reflects the value of $1
invested in a spread. Changes in the series will reflect changes in PnL, the series will
be strictly positive (at worst, infinitesimal), and the implementation shortfall will be
taken into account. This will be the series used to model, generate signals, and trade,
as if it were an ETF.
Suppose that we are given a history of bars, as derived from any of the methods
explained in Section 2.3. These bars contain the following columns:
r oi,t is the raw open price of instrument i = 1, … , I at bar t = 1, … , T.
r pi,t is the raw close price of instrument i = 1, … , I at bar t = 1, … , T.
r 𝜑i,t is the USD value of one point of instrument i = 1, … , I at bar t = 1, … , T.
This includes foreign exchange rate.
r vi,t is the volume of instrument i = 1, … , I at bar t = 1, … , T.
r di,t is the carry, dividend, or coupon paid by instrument i at bar t. This variable
can also be used to charge margin costs, or costs of funding.
where all instruments i = 1, … , I were tradeable at bar t = 1, … , T. In other words,
even if some instruments were not tradeable over the entirety of the time interval
[t −1, t], at least they were tradeable at times t −1 and t (markets were open and
able to execute orders at those instants). For a basket of futures characterized by an

value {Kt} is derived as

and K0 = 1 in the initial AUM. Variable hi,t represents the holdings (number of
securities or contracts) of instrument i at time t. Variable 𝛿i,t is the change of mar-
ket value between t −1 and t for instrument i. Note that profits or losses are being
reinvested whenever t ∈B, hence preventing the negative prices. Dividends di,t are
already embedded in Kt, so there is no need for the strategy to know about them.
The purpose of 𝜔i,t
(∑I
i=1 |𝜔i,t|
)−1
in hi,t is to de-lever the allocations. For series of
futures, we may not know pi,t of the new contract at a roll time t, so we use oi,t+1 as
the closest in time.
Let 𝜏i be the transaction cost associated with trading $1 of instrument i, e.g., 𝜏i =
1E −4 (one basis point). There are three additional variables that the strategy needs
to know for every observed bar t:
1. Rebalance costs: The variable cost {ct} associated with the allocation rebal-
ance is ct = ∑I
i=1(|hi,t−1|pi,t + |hi,t|oi,t+1)𝜑i,t𝜏i, ∀t ∈B. We do not embed ct in
Kt, or shorting the spread will generate fictitious profits when the allocation is
rebalanced. In your code, you can treat {ct} as a (negative) dividend.
2. Bid-ask spread: The cost {̃ct} of buying or selling one unit of this virtual ETF
is̃ ct = ∑I
i=1 |hi,t−1|pi,t𝜑i,t𝜏i. When a unit is bought or sold, the strategy must
charge this cost̃ ct, which is the equivalent to crossing the bid-ask spread of this
virtual ETF.
3. Volume: The volume traded {vt} is determined by the least active member in
the basket. Let vi,t be the volume traded by instrument i over bar t. The number
of tradeable basket units is vt = min
i
{
vi,t
|hi,t−1|
}
.
Transaction costs functions are not necessarily linear, and those non-linear costs
can be simulated by the strategy based on the above information. Thanks to the ETF
trick, we can model a basket of futures (or a single futures) as if it was a single non-
expiring cash product.

PCA Weights
The interested reader will find many practical ways of computing hedging weights
in L´opez de Prado and Leinweber [2012] and Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012].
For the sake of completeness, let us review one way to derive the vector {𝜔t} used
in the previous section. Consider an IID multivariate Gaussian process characterized
by a vector of means 𝜇, of size Nx1, and a covariance matrix V, of size NxN. This
stochastic process describes an invariant random variable, like the returns of stocks,
the changes in yield of bonds, or changes in options’ volatilities, for a portfolio of N
instruments. We would like to compute the vector of allocations 𝜔that conforms to
a particular distribution of risks across V’s principal components.
First, we perform a spectral decomposition, VW = WΛ, where the columns in W
are reordered so that the elements of Λ’s diagonal are sorted in descending order.
Second, given a vector of allocations 𝜔, we can compute the portfolio’s risk as 𝜎2 =
𝜔′V𝜔= 𝜔′WΛW′𝜔= 𝛽′Λ𝛽= (Λ
1∕2𝛽)′(Λ
1∕2𝛽), where 𝛽represents the projection of
𝜔on the orthogonal basis. Third, Λ is a diagonal matrix, thus 𝜎2 = ∑N
n=1 𝛽2
nΛn,n,
and the risk attributed to the nth component is Rn = 𝛽2
nΛn,n𝜎−2 = [W′𝜔]2
nΛn,n𝜎−2,
with R′1N = 1, and 1N is a vector of N ones. You can interpret {Rn}n=1,…,N as the
distribution of risks across the orthogonal components.
Fourth, we would like to compute the vector 𝜔that delivers a user-defined risk dis-
tribution R. From earlier steps, 𝛽=
{
𝜎
√
Rn
Λn,n
}
n=1,…,N
, which represents the allo-
cation in the new (orthogonal) basis. Fifth, the allocation in the old basis is given by
𝜔= W𝛽. Re-scaling 𝜔merely re-scales 𝜎, hence keeping the risk distribution con-
stant. Figure 2.2 illustrates the contribution to risk per principal component for an

inverse variance allocation. Almost all principal components contribute risk, includ-
ing those with highest variance (components 1 and 2). In contrast, for the PCA port-
folio, only the component with lowest variance contributes risk.
Snippet 2.1 implements this method, where the user-defined risk distribution
R is passed through argument riskDist (optional None). If riskDist is None,
the code will assume all risk must be allocated to the principal component with
smallest eigenvalue, and the weights will be the last eigenvector re-scaled to match
𝜎(riskTarget).

2.4.3
Single Future Roll
The ETF trick can handle the rolls of a single futures contract, as a particular case of a
1-legged spread. However, when dealing with a single futures contract, an equivalent
and more direct approach is to form a time series of cumulative roll gaps, and detract
that gaps series from the price series. Snippet 2.2 shows a possible implementation
of this logic, using a series of tick bars downloaded from Bloomberg and stored in a
HDF5 table. The meaning of the Bloomberg fields is as follows:
r FUT_CUR_GEN_TICKER: It identifies the contract associated with that price. Its
value changes with every roll.
r PX_OPEN: The open price associated with that bar.
r PX_LAST: The close price associated with the bar.
r VWAP: The volume-weighted average price associated with that bar.
The argument matchEnd in function rollGaps determines whether the
futures series should be rolled forward (matchEnd=False) or backward
(matchEnd=True). In a forward roll, the price at the start of the rolled series

## Page 64

matches the price at the start of the raw series. In a backward roll, the price at the
end of the rolled series matches the price at the end of the raw series.

Rolled prices are used for simulating PnL and portfolio mark-to-market values.
However, raw prices should still be used to size positions and determine capital con-
sumption. Keep in mind, rolled prices can indeed become negative, particularly in
futures contracts that sold off while in contango. To see this, run Snippet 2.2 on a
series of Cotton #2 futures or Natural Gas futures.
In general, we wish to work with non-negative rolled series, in which case we
can derive the price series of a $1 investment as follows: (1) Compute a time series
of rolled futures prices, (2) compute the return (r) as rolled price change divided
by the previous raw price, and (3) form a price series using those returns (i.e.,
(1+r).cumprod()). Snippet 2.3 illustrates this logic.

SAMPLING FEATURES
So far we have learned how to produce a continuous, homogeneous, and structured
dataset from a collection of unstructured financial data. Although you could attempt to
apply an ML algorithm on such a dataset, in general that would not be a good idea, for
a couple of reasons. First, several ML algorithms do not scale well with sample size
(e.g., SVMs). Second, ML algorithms achieve highest accuracy when they attempt to
learn from relevant examples. Suppose that you wish to predict whether the next 5%
absolute return will be positive (a 5% rally) or negative (a 5% sell-off). At any random
time, the accuracy of such a prediction will be low. However, if we ask a classifier to
predict the sign of the next 5% absolute return after certain catalytic conditions, we
are more likely to find informative features that will help us achieve a more accurate
prediction. In this section we discuss ways of sampling bars to produce a features
matrix with relevant training examples.
2.5.1
Sampling for Reduction
As we have mentioned earlier, one reason for sampling features from a structured
dataset is to reduce the amount of data used to fit the ML algorithm. This operation
is also referred to as downsampling. This is often done by either sequential sampling
at a constant step size (linspace sampling), or by sampling randomly using a uniform
distribution (uniform sampling).
The main advantage of linspace sampling is its simplicity. The disadvantages are
that the step size is arbitrary, and that outcomes may vary depending on the seed bar.
Uniform sampling addresses these concerns by drawing samples uniformly across the
entire set of bars. Still, both methods suffer the criticism that the sample does not nec-
essarily contain the subset of most relevant observations in terms of their predictive
power or informational content.
2.5.2
Event-Based Sampling
Portfolio managers typically place a bet after some event takes place, such as a struc-
tural break (Chapter 17), an extracted signal (Chapter 18), or microstructural phenom-
ena (Chapter 19). These events could be associated with the release of some macroe-
conomic statistics, a spike in volatility, a significant departure in a spread away from
its equilibrium level, etc. We can characterize an event as significant, and let the ML
algorithm learn whether there is an accurate prediction function under those circum-
stances. Perhaps the answer is no, in which case we would redefine what constitutes
an event, or try again with alternative features. For illustration purposes, let us discuss
one useful event-based sampling method.
2.5.2.1
The CUSUM Filter
The CUSUM filter is a quality-control method, designed to detect a shift in
the mean value of a measured quantity away from a target value. Consider IID

with boundary condition S0 = 0. This procedure would recommend an action at the
first t satisfying St ≥h, for some threshold h (the filter size). Note that St = 0 when-
ever yt ≤Et−1[yt] −St−1. This zero floor means that we will skip some downward
deviations that otherwise would make St negative. The reason is, the filter is set up to
identify a sequence of upside divergences from any reset level zero. In particular, the
threshold is activated when
St ≥h ⇔∃𝜏∈[1, t]
||||||
t∑
i=𝜏
(yi −Ei−1
[yt
]) ≥h
This concept of run-ups can be extended to include run-downs, giving us a sym-
metric CUSUM filter:
S+
t = max {0, S+
t−1 + yt −Et−1
[yt
]} , S+
0 = 0
S−
t = min {0, S−
t−1 + yt −Et−1
[yt

0 = 0
St = max {S+

}
Lam and Yam [1997] propose an investment strategy whereby alternating buy-sell
signals are generated when an absolute return h is observed relative to a prior high
or low. Those authors demonstrate that such strategy is equivalent to the so-called
“filter trading strategy” studied by Fama and Blume [1966]. Our use of the CUSUM
filter is different: We will sample a bar t if and only if St ≥h, at which point St is
reset. Snippet 2.4 shows an implementation of the symmetric CUSUM filter, where
Et−1[yt] = yt−1.

CUSUM sampling of a price series
The function getTEvents receives two arguments: the raw time series we wish
to filter (gRaw) and the threshold, h. One practical aspect that makes CUSUM filters
appealing is that multiple events are not triggered by gRaw hovering around a thresh-
old level, which is a flaw suffered by popular market signals such as Bollinger bands.
It will require a full run of length h for gRaw to trigger an event. Figure 2.3 illustrates
the samples taken by a CUSUM filter on a price series.
Variable St could be based on any of the features we will discuss in Chapters 17–
19, like structural break statistics, entropy, or market microstructure measurements.
For example, we could declare an event whenever SADF departs sufficiently from a
previous reset level (to be defined in Chapter 17). Once we have obtained this subset
of event-driven bars, we will let the ML algorithm determine whether the occurrence
of such events constitutes actionable intelligence.

CHAPTER 3
Labeling
3.1
MOTIVATION
In Chapter 2 we discussed how to produce a matrix X of financial features out of an
unstructured dataset. Unsupervised learning algorithms can learn the patterns from
that matrix X, for example whether it contains hierarchical clusters. On the other hand,
supervised learning algorithms require that the rows in X are associated with an array
of labels or values y, so that those labels or values can be predicted on unseen features
samples. In this chapter we will discuss ways to label financial data.
3.2
THE FIXED-TIME HORIZON METHOD
As it relates to finance, virtually all ML papers label observations using the fixed-time
horizon method. This method can be described as follows. Consider a features matrix
X with I rows, {Xi}i=1,…,I, drawn from some bars with index t = 1, …, T, where I ≤T.
Chapter 2, Section 2.5 discussed sampling methods that produce the set of features
{Xi}i=1,…,I. An observation Xi is assigned a label yi ∈{−1, 0, 1},
yi =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
−1
if rti,0,ti,0+h < −𝜏
0
if |rti,0,ti,0+h| ≤𝜏
1
if rti,0,ti,0+h > 𝜏
where 𝜏is a pre-defined constant threshold, ti,0 is the index of the bar immediately
after Xi takes place, ti,0 + h is the index of the h-th bar after ti,0, and rti,0,ti,0+h is the
price return over a bar horizon h,
rti,0,ti,0+h =
pti,0+h
pti,0
−1
43

## Page 71

LABELING
Because the literature almost always works with time bars, h implies a fixed-time
horizon. The bibliography section lists multiple ML studies, of which Dixon et al.
[2016] is a recent example of this labeling method. Despite its popularity, there are
several reasons to avoid this approach in most cases. First, as we saw in Chapter
2, time bars do not exhibit good statistical properties. Second, the same threshold
𝜏is applied regardless of the observed volatility. Suppose that 𝜏= 1E −2, where
sometimes we label an observation as yi = 1 subject to a realized bar volatility of
𝜎ti,0 = 1E −4 (e.g., during the night session), and sometimes 𝜎ti,0 = 1E −2 (e.g.,
around the open). The large majority of labels will be 0, even if return rti,0,ti,0+h was
predictable and statistically significant.
In other words, it is a very common error to label observations according to a
fixed threshold on time bars. Here are a couple of better alternatives. First, label per
a varying threshold 𝜎ti,0, estimated using a rolling exponentially weighted standard
deviation of returns. Second, use volume or dollar bars, as their volatilities are much
closer to constant (homoscedasticity). But even these two improvements miss a key
flaw of the fixed-time horizon method: the path followed by prices. Every investment
strategy has stop-loss limits, whether they are self-imposed by the portfolio manager,
enforced by the risk department, or triggered by a margin call. It is simply unrealistic
to build a strategy that profits from positions that would have been stopped-out by the
exchange. That virtually no publication accounts for that when labeling observations
tells you something about the current state of the investment literature.
3.3
COMPUTING DYNAMIC THRESHOLDS
As argued in the previous section, in practice we want to set profit taking and stop-
loss limits that are a function of the risks involved in a bet. Otherwise, sometimes we
will be aiming too high (𝜏≫𝜎ti,0), and sometimes too low (𝜏≪𝜎ti,0), considering
the prevailing volatility.
Snippet 3.1 computes the daily volatility at intraday estimation points, applying a
span of span0 days to an exponentially weighted moving standard deviation. See the
pandas documentation for details on the pandas.Series.ewm function.
SNIPPET 3.1
DAILY VOLATILITY ESTIMATES
def getDailyVol(close,span0=100):
# daily vol, reindexed to close
df0=close.index.searchsorted(close.index-pd.Timedelta(days=1))
df0=df0[df0>0]
df0=pd.Series(close.index[df0–1], index=close.index[close.shape[0]-df0.shape[0]:])
df0=close.loc[df0.index]/close.loc[df0.values].values-1 # daily returns
df0=df0.ewm(span=span0).std()
return df0
We can use the output of this function to set default profit taking and stop-loss
limits throughout the rest of this chapter.

3.4
THE TRIPLE-BARRIER METHOD
Here I will introduce an alternative labeling method that I have not found in the liter-
ature. If you are an investment professional, I think you will agree that it makes more
sense. I call it the triple-barrier method because it labels an observation according to
the first barrier touched out of three barriers. First, we set two horizontal barriers and
one vertical barrier. The two horizontal barriers are defined by profit-taking and stop-
loss limits, which are a dynamic function of estimated volatility (whether realized
or implied). The third barrier is defined in terms of number of bars elapsed since the
position was taken (an expiration limit). If the upper barrier is touched first, we label
the observation as a 1. If the lower barrier is touched first, we label the observation
as a −1. If the vertical barrier is touched first, we have two choices: the sign of the
return, or a 0. I personally prefer the former as a matter of realizing a profit or loss
within limits, but you should explore whether a 0 works better in your particular
problems.
You may have noticed that the triple-barrier method is path-dependent. In order to
label an observation, we must take into account the entire path spanning [ti,0, ti,0 + h],
where h defines the vertical barrier (the expiration limit). We will denote ti,1 the time
of the first barrier touch, and the return associated with the observed feature is rti,0,ti,1.
For the sake of clarity, ti,1 ≤ti,0 + h and the horizontal barriers are not necessarily
symmetric.
Snippet 3.2 implements the triple-barrier method. The function receives four
arguments:
r close: A pandas series of prices.
r events: A pandas dataframe, with columns,
◦t1: The timestamp of vertical barrier. When the value is np.nan, there will
not be a vertical barrier.
◦trgt: The unit width of the horizontal barriers.
r ptSl: A list of two non-negative float values:
◦ptSl[0]: The factor that multiplies trgt to set the width of the upper barrier.
If 0, there will not be an upper barrier.
◦ptSl[1]: The factor that multiplies trgt to set the width of the lower barrier.
If 0, there will not be a lower barrier.
r molecule: A list with the subset of event indices that will be processed by a
single thread. Its use will become clear later on in the chapter.

out.loc[loc,'pt']=df0[df0>pt[loc]].index.min() # earliest profit taking.
return out
The output from this function is a pandas dataframe containing the timestamps (if
any) at which each barrier was touched. As you can see from the previous description,
the method considers the possibility that each of the three barriers may be disabled.
Let us denote a barrier configuration by the triplet [pt,sl,t1], where a 0 means
that the barrier is inactive and a 1 means that the barrier is active. The possible eight
configurations are:
r Three useful configurations:
◦[1,1,1]: This is the standard setup, where we define three barrier exit condi-
tions. We would like to realize a profit, but we have a maximum tolerance for
losses and a holding period.
◦[0,1,1]: In this setup, we would like to exit after a number of bars, unless we
are stopped-out.
◦[1,1,0]: Here we would like to take a profit as long as we are not stopped-out.
This is somewhat unrealistic in that we are willing to hold the position for as
long as it takes.
r Three less realistic configurations:
◦[0,0,1]: This is equivalent to the fixed-time horizon method. It may still be
useful when applied to volume-, dollar-, or information-driven bars, and mul-
tiple forecasts are updated within the horizon.
◦[1,0,1]: A position is held until a profit is made or the maximum holding
period is exceeded, without regard for the intermediate unrealized losses.
◦[1,0,0]: A position is held until a profit is made. It could mean being locked
on a losing position for years.
r Two illogical configurations:
◦[0,1,0]: This is an aimless configuration, where we hold a position until we
are stopped-out.
◦[0,0,0]: There are no barriers. The position is locked forever, and no label is
generated.
Figure 3.1 shows two alternative configurations of the triple-barrier method. On
the left, the configuration is [1,1,0], where the first barrier touched is the lower
horizontal one. On the right, the configuration is [1,1,1], where the first barrier
touched is the vertical one.

LEARNING SIDE AND SIZE
In this section we will discuss how to label examples so that an ML algorithm can
learn both the side and the size of a bet. We are interested in learning the side of a
bet when we do not have an underlying model to set the sign of our position (long
or short). Under such circumstance, we cannot differentiate between a profit-taking
barrier and a stop-loss barrier, since that requires knowledge of the side. Learning the
side implies that either there are no horizontal barriers or that the horizontal barriers
must be symmetric.
Snippet 3.3 implements the function getEvents, which finds the time of the first
barrier touch. The function receives the following arguments:
r close: A pandas series of prices.
r tEvents: The pandas timeindex containing the timestamps that will seed every
triple barrier. These are the timestamps selected by the sampling procedures
discussed in Chapter 2, Section 2.5.
r ptSl: A non-negative float that sets the width of the two barriers. A 0 value
means that the respective horizontal barrier (profit taking and/or stop loss) will
be disabled.
r t1: A pandas series with the timestamps of the vertical barriers. We pass a
False when we want to disable vertical barriers.
r trgt: A pandas series of targets, expressed in terms of absolute returns.
r minRet: The minimum target return required for running a triple barrier search.
r numThreads: The number of threads concurrently used by the function.

expensive unless you are familiar with multi-threading, and this is one of them. Here
is where parallel computing comes into play. Chapter 20 discusses a few multipro-
cessing functions that we will use throughout the book.
Function mpPandasObj calls a multiprocessing engine, which is explained in
depth in Chapter 20. For the moment, you simply need to know that this function will
execute applyPtSlOnT1 in parallel. Function applyPtSlOnT1 returns the times-
tamps at which each barrier is touched (if any). Then, the time of the first touch is
the earliest time among the three returned by applyPtSlOnT1. Because we must
learn the side of the bet, we have passed ptSl= [ptSl,ptSl] as argument, and we
arbitrarily set the side to be always long (the horizontal barriers are symmetric, so
the side is irrelevant to determining the time of the first touch). The output from this
function is a pandas dataframe with columns:
r t1: The timestamp at which the first barrier is touched.
r trgt: The target that was used to generate the horizontal barriers.
Snippet 3.4 shows one way to define a vertical barrier. For each index in tEvents,
it finds the timestamp of the next price bar at or immediately after a number
of days numDays. This vertical barrier can be passed as optional argument t1
in getEvents.
SNIPPET 3.4
ADDING A VERTICAL BARRIER
t1=close.index.searchsorted(tEvents+pd.Timedelta(days=numDays))
t1=t1[t1<close.shape[0]]
t1=pd.Series(close.index[t1],index=tEvents[:t1.shape[0]]) # NaNs at end
Finally, we can label the observations using the getBins function defined in Snip-
pet 3.5. The arguments are the events dataframe we just discussed, and the close
pandas series of prices. The output is a dataframe with columns:
r ret: The return realized at the time of the first touched barrier.
r bin: The label, {−1, 0, 1}, as a function of the sign of the outcome. The function
can be easily adjusted to label as 0 those events when the vertical barrier was
touched first, which we leave as an exercise.

META-LABELING
Suppose that you have a model for setting the side of the bet (long or short). You just
need to learn the size of that bet, which includes the possibility of no bet at all (zero
size). This is a situation that practitioners face regularly. We often know whether we
want to buy or sell a product, and the only remaining question is how much money
we should risk in such a bet. We do not want the ML algorithm to learn the side, just
to tell us what is the appropriate size. At this point, it probably does not surprise you
to hear that no book or paper has so far discussed this common problem. Thankfully,
that misery ends here. I call this problem meta-labeling because we want to build a
secondary ML model that learns how to use a primary exogenous model.
Rather than writing an entirely new getEvents function, we will make some
adjustments to the previous code, in order to handle meta-labeling. First, we accept a
new side optional argument (with default None), which contains the side of our bets
as decided by the primary model. When side is not None, the function understands
that meta-labeling is in play. Second, because now we know the side, we can effec-
tively discriminate between profit taking and stop loss. The horizontal barriers do not
need to be symmetric, as in Section 3.5. Argument ptSl is a list of two non-negative
float values, where ptSl[0] is the factor that multiplies trgt to set the width of
the upper barrier, and ptSl[1] is the factor that multiplies trgt to set the width
of the lower barrier. When either is 0, the respective barrier is disabled. Snippet 3.6
implements these enhancements.

out['bin']=np.sign(out['ret'])
if 'side' in events_:out.loc[out['ret']<=0,'bin']=0 # meta-labeling
return out
Now the possible values for labels in out['bin'] are {0,1}, as opposed to
the previous feasible values {−1,0,1}. The ML algorithm will be trained to decide
whether to take the bet or pass, a purely binary prediction. When the predicted label
is 1, we can use the probability of this secondary prediction to derive the size of the
bet, where the side (sign) of the position has been set by the primary model.
3.7
HOW TO USE META-LABELING
Binary classification problems present a trade-off between type-I errors (false posi-
tives) and type-II errors (false negatives). In general, increasing the true positive rate
of a binary classifier will tend to increase its false positive rate. The receiver operating

## Page 79

LABELING
FIGURE 3.2
A visualization of the “confusion matrix”
characteristic (ROC) curve of a binary classifier measures the cost of increasing the
true positive rate, in terms of accepting higher false positive rates.
Figure 3.2 illustrates the so-called “confusion matrix.” On a set of observations,
there are items that exhibit a condition (positives, left rectangle), and items that do not
exhibit a condition (negative, right rectangle). A binary classifier predicts that some
items exhibit the condition (ellipse), where the TP area contains the true positives
and the TN area contains the true negatives. This leads to two kinds of errors: false
positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). “Precision” is the ratio between the TP area
and the area in the ellipse. “Recall” is the ratio between the TP area and the area
in the left rectangle. This notion of recall (aka true positive rate) is in the context
of classification problems, the analogous to “power” in the context of hypothesis
testing. “Accuracy” is the sum of the TP and TN areas divided by the overall set of
items (square). In general, decreasing the FP area comes at a cost of increasing the
FN area, because higher precision typically means fewer calls, hence lower recall.
Still, there is some combination of precision and recall that maximizes the overall
efficiency of the classifier. The F1-score measures the efficiency of a classifier as the
harmonic average between precision and recall (more on this in Chapter 14).
Meta-labeling is particularly helpful when you want to achieve higher F1-scores.
First, we build a model that achieves high recall, even if the precision is not
particularly high. Second, we correct for the low precision by applying meta-labeling
to the positives predicted by the primary model.

## Page 80

THE QUANTAMENTAL WAY
53
Meta-labeling will increase your F1-score by filtering out the false positives, where
the majority of positives have already been identified by the primary model. Stated
differently, the role of the secondary ML algorithm is to determine whether a positive
from the primary (exogenous) model is true or false. It is not its purpose to come up
with a betting opportunity. Its purpose is to determine whether we should act or pass
on the opportunity that has been presented.
Meta-labeling is a very powerful tool to have in your arsenal, for four additional
reasons. First, ML algorithms are often criticized as black boxes (see Chapter 1).
Meta-labeling allows you to build an ML system on top of a white box (like a funda-
mental model founded on economic theory). This ability to transform a fundamental
model into an ML model should make meta-labeling particularly useful to “quanta-
mental” firms. Second, the effects of overfitting are limited when you apply meta-
labeling, because ML will not decide the side of your bet, only the size. Third, by
decoupling the side prediction from the size prediction, meta-labeling enables sophis-
ticated strategy structures. For instance, consider that the features driving a rally may
differ from the features driving a sell-off. In that case, you may want to develop an
ML strategy exclusively for long positions, based on the buy recommendations of
a primary model, and an ML strategy exclusively for short positions, based on the
sell recommendations of an entirely different primary model. Fourth, achieving high
accuracy on small bets and low accuracy on large bets will ruin you. As important as
identifying good opportunities is to size them properly, so it makes sense to develop
an ML algorithm solely focused on getting that critical decision (sizing) right. We will
retake this fourth point in Chapter 10. In my experience, meta-labeling ML models
can deliver more robust and reliable outcomes than standard labeling models.
3.8
THE QUANTAMENTAL WAY
You may have read in the press that many hedge funds are embracing the quanta-
mental approach. A simple Google search will show reports that many hedge funds,
including some of the most traditional ones, are investing tens of millions of dollars in
technologies designed to combine human expertise with quantitative methods. It turns
out, meta-labeling is exactly what these people have been waiting for. Let us see why.
Suppose that you have a series of features that you believe can forecast some
prices, you just do not know how. Since you do not have a model to determine the side
of each bet, you need to learn both side and size. You apply what you have learned in
Section 3.5, and produce some labels based on the triple-barrier method with sym-
metric horizontal barriers. Now you are ready to fit your algorithm on a training set,
and evaluate the accuracy of your forecasts on a testing set. Alternatively, you could
do the following:
1. Use your forecasts from the primary model, and generate meta-labels. Remem-
ber, horizontal barriers do not need to be symmetric in this case.
2. Fit your model again on the same training set, but this time using the meta-
labels you just generated.
3. Combine the “sides” from the first ML model with the “sizes” from the second
ML model.

LABELING
You can always add a meta-labeling layer to any primary model, whether that is an
ML algorithm, an econometric equation, a technical trading rule, a fundamental anal-
ysis, etc. That includes forecasts generated by a human, solely based on his intuition.
In that case, meta-labeling will help us figure out when we should pursue or dismiss
a discretionary PM’s call. The features used by such meta-labeling ML algorithm
could range from market information to biometric statistics to psychological assess-
ments. For example, the meta-labeling ML algorithm could find that discretionary
PMs tend to make particularly good calls when there is a structural break (Chapter
17), as they may be quicker to grasp a change in the market regime. Conversely, it
may find that PMs under stress, as evidenced by fewer hours of sleep, fatigue, change
in weight, etc. tend to make inaccurate predictions.1 Many professions require regular
psychological exams, and an ML meta-labeling algorithm may find that those scores
are also relevant to assess our current degree of confidence on a PM’s predictions.
Perhaps none of these factors affect discretionary PMs, and their brains operate inde-
pendently from their emotional being, like cold calculating machines. My guess is
that this is not the case, and therefore meta-labeling should become an essential ML
technique for every discretionary hedge fund. In the near future, every discretionary
hedge fund will become a quantamental firm, and meta-labeling offers them a clear
path to make that transition.
3.9
DROPPING UNNECESSARY LABELS
Some ML classifiers do not perform well when classes are too imbalanced. In those
circumstances, it is preferable to drop extremely rare labels and focus on the more
common outcomes. Snippet 3.8 presents a procedure that recursively drops obser-
vations associated with extremely rare labels. Function dropLabels recursively
eliminates those observations associated with classes that appear less than a fraction
minPct of cases, unless there are only two classes left.
SNIPPET 3.8
DROPPING UNDER-POPULATED LABELS
def dropLabels(events,minPtc=.05):
# apply weights, drop labels with insufficient examples
while True:
df0=events['bin'].value_counts(normalize=True)
if df0.min()>minPct or df0.shape[0]<3:break
print 'dropped label',df0.argmin(),df0.min()
events=events[events['bin']!=df0.argmin()]
return events
1 You are probably aware of at least one large hedge fund that monitors the emotional state of their research
analysts on a daily basis.

EXERCISES

Incidentally, another reason you may want to drop unnecessary labels is this known
sklearn bug: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8566. This sort of bug
is a consequence of very fundamental assumptions in sklearn implementation, and
resolving them is far from trivial. In this particular instance, the error stems from
sklearn’s decision to operate with standard numpy arrays rather than structured arrays
or pandas objects. It is unlikely that there will be a fix by the time you are reading
this chapter, or in the near future. In later chapters, we will study ways to circumvent
these sorts of implementation errors, by building your own classes and expanding
sklearn’s functionality.
EXERCISES
3.1 Form dollar bars for E-mini S&P 500 futures:
(a) Apply a symmetric CUSUM filter (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2.1) where the
threshold is the standard deviation of daily returns (Snippet 3.1).
(b) Use Snippet 3.4 on a pandas series t1, where numDays= 1.
(c) On those sampled features, apply the triple-barrier method, where
ptSl = [1,1] and t1 is the series you created in point 1.b.
(d) Apply getBins to generate the labels.
3.2 From exercise 1, use Snippet 3.8 to drop rare labels.
3.3 Adjust the getBins function (Snippet 3.5) to return a 0 whenever the vertical
barrier is the one touched first.
3.4 Develop a trend-following strategy based on a popular technical analysis statistic
(e.g., crossing moving averages). For each observation, the model suggests a side,
but not a size of the bet.
(a) Derive meta-labels for ptSl= [1,2] and t1 where numDays= 1. Use as
trgt the daily standard deviation as computed by Snippet 3.1.
(b) Train a random forest to decide whether to trade or not. Note: The decision
is whether to trade or not, {0,1}, since the underlying model (the crossing
moving average) has decided the side, {−1,1}.
3.5 Develop a mean-reverting strategy based on Bollinger bands. For each observa-
tion, the model suggests a side, but not a size of the bet.
(a) Derive meta-labels for ptSl= [0,2] and t1 where numDays= 1. Use as
trgt the daily standard deviation as computed by Snippet 3.1.
(b) Train a random forest to decide whether to trade or not. Use as fea-
tures: volatility, serial correlation, and the crossing moving averages from
exercise 2.
(c) What is the accuracy of predictions from the primary model (i.e., if the sec-
ondary model does not filter the bets)? What are the precision, recall, and
F1-scores?
(d) What is the accuracy of predictions from the secondary model? What are the
precision, recall, and F1-scores?

CHAPTER 4
Sample Weights
4.1
MOTIVATION
Chapter 3 presented several new methods for labeling financial observations. We
introduced two novel concepts, the triple-barrier method and meta-labeling, and
explained how they are useful in financial applications, including quantamental
investment strategies. In this chapter you will learn how to use sample weights to
address another problem ubiquitous in financial applications, namely that observa-
tions are not generated by independent and identically distributed (IID) processes.
Most of the ML literature is based on the IID assumption, and one reason many ML
applications fail in finance is because those assumptions are unrealistic in the case of
financial time series.
4.2
OVERLAPPING OUTCOMES
In Chapter 3 we assigned a label yi to an observed feature Xi, where yi was a function
of price bars that occurred over an interval [ti,0, ti,1
]. When ti,1 > tj,0 and i < j, then yi
and yj will both depend on a common return rtj,0,min{ti,1,tj,1
}, that is, the return over the
interval [tj,0, min {ti,1, tj,1
}]. The implication is that the series of labels, {yi
}
i=1,…,I,
are not IID whenever there is an overlap between any two consecutive outcomes,
∃i ||ti,1 > ti+1,0 .
Suppose that we circumvent this problem by restricting the bet horizon to ti,1 ≤
ti+1,0. In this case there is no overlap, because every feature outcome is determined
before or at the onset of the next observed feature. That would lead to coarse mod-
els where the features’ sampling frequency would be limited by the horizon used to
determine the outcome. On one hand, if we wished to investigate outcomes that lasted
a month, features would have to be sampled with a frequency up to monthly. On the
other hand, if we increased the sampling frequency to let’s say daily, we would be
59

## Page 87

60
SAMPLE WEIGHTS
forced to reduce the outcome’s horizon to one day. Furthermore, if we wished to
apply a path-dependent labeling technique, like the triple-barrier method, the sam-
pling frequency would be subordinated to the first barrier’s touch. No matter what
you do, restricting the outcome’s horizon to eliminate overlaps is a terrible solution.
We must allow ti,1 > ti+1,0, which brings us back to the problem of overlapping out-
comes described earlier.
This situation is characteristic of financial applications. Most non-financial ML
researchers can assume that observations are drawn from IID processes. For exam-
ple, you can obtain blood samples from a large number of patients, and measure their
cholesterol. Of course, various underlying common factors will shift the mean and
standard deviation of the cholesterol distribution, but the samples are still indepen-
dent: There is one observation per subject. Suppose you take those blood samples,
and someone in your laboratory spills blood from each tube into the following nine
tubes to their right. That is, tube 10 contains blood for patient 10, but also blood from
patients 1 through 9. Tube 11 contains blood from patient 11, but also blood from
patients 2 through 10, and so on. Now you need to determine the features predictive
of high cholesterol (diet, exercise, age, etc.), without knowing for sure the choles-
terol level of each patient. That is the equivalent challenge that we face in financial
ML, with the additional handicap that the spillage pattern is non-deterministic and
unknown. Finance is not a plug-and-play subject as it relates to ML applications.
Anyone who tells you otherwise will waste your time and money.
There are several ways to attack the problem of non-IID labels, and in this chapter
we will address it by designing sampling and weighting schemes that correct for the
undue influence of overlapping outcomes.
4.3
NUMBER OF CONCURRENT LABELS
Two labels yi and yj are concurrent at t when both are a function of at least one com-
mon return, rt−1,t =
pt
pt−1 −1. The overlap does not need to be perfect, in the sense of
both labels spanning the same time interval. In this section we are going to compute
the number of labels that are a function of a given return, rt−1,t. First, for each time
point t = 1, … , T, we form a binary array, {1t,i
}
i=1,…,I, where 1t,i ∈{0, 1}. Variable
1t,i = 1 if and only if [ti,0, ti,1
] overlaps with [t −1, t] and 1t,i = 0 otherwise. Recall
that the labels’ spans {[ti,0, ti,1
]}
i=1,…,I are defined by the t1 object introduced in
Chapter 3. Second, we compute the number of labels concurrent at t, ct = ∑I
i=1 1t,i.
Snippet 4.1 illustrates an implementation of this logic.

return count.loc[molecule[0]:t1[molecule].max()]
4.4
AVERAGE UNIQUENESS OF A LABEL
In this section we are going to estimate a label’s uniqueness (non-overlap) as its
average uniqueness over its lifespan. First, the uniqueness of a label i at time t is
ut,i = 1t,ic−1
t . Second, the average uniqueness of label i is the average ut,i over the
label’s lifespan,̄ ui =
(∑T
t=1 ut,i
) (∑T
t=1 1t,i
)−1
. This average uniqueness can also
be interpreted as the reciprocal of the harmonic average of ct over the event’s lifes-
pan. Figure 4.1 plots the histogram of uniqueness values derived from an object t1.
Snippet 4.2 implements this calculation.

out['tW']=mpPandasObj(mpSampleTW,('molecule',events.index),numThreads, \
t1=events['t1'],numCoEvents=numCoEvents)
Note that we are making use again of the function mpPandasObj, which speeds up
calculations via multiprocessing (see Chapter 20). Computing the average uniqueness
associated with label i,̄ ui, requires information that is not available until a future time,
events['t1']. This is not a problem, because {̄ui
}
i=1,…,I are used on the training
set in combination with label information, and not on the testing set. These {̄ui
}
i=1,…,I
are not used for forecasting the label, hence there is no information leakage. This
procedure allows us to assign a uniqueness score between 0 and 1 for each observed
feature, in terms of non-overlapping outcomes.
4.5
BAGGING CLASSIFIERS AND UNIQUENESS
The probability of not selecting a particular item i after I draws with replacement on
a set of I items is (1 −I−1)I. As the sample size grows, that probability converges to
the asymptotic value limI→∞(1 −I−1)I = e−1. That means that the number of unique
observations drawn is expected to be (1 −e−1) ≈2
3.
Suppose that the maximum number of non-overlapping outcomes is K ≤I. Fol-
lowing the same argument, the probability of not selecting a particular item i after I
draws with replacement on a set of I items is (1 −K−1)I. As the sample size grows,
that probability can be approximated as (1 −I−1)I K
I ≈e−K
I . That means that the num-
ber of unique observations drawn is expected to be 1 −e−K
I ≤1 −e−1. The implica-
tion is that incorrectly assuming IID draws leads to oversampling.
When

on
observations
with
I−1 ∑I
i=1̄ ui ≪1, it becomes increasingly likely that in-bag observations will
be (1) redundant to each other, and (2) very similar to out-of-bag observations.

## Page 90

BAGGING CLASSIFIERS AND UNIQUENESS
63
Redundancy of draws makes the bootstrap inefficient (see Chapter 6). For exam-
ple, in the case of a random forest, all trees in the forest will essentially be
very similar copies of a single overfit decision tree. And because the random
sampling makes out-of-bag examples very similar to the in-bag ones, out-of-bag
accuracy will be grossly inflated. We will address this second issue in Chapter
7, when we study cross-validation under non-IID observations. For the moment,
let us concentrate on the first issue, namely bagging under observations where
I−1 ∑I
i=1̄ ui ≪1.
A first solution is to drop overlapping outcomes before performing the bootstrap.
Because overlaps are not perfect, dropping an observation just because there is a
partial overlap will result in an extreme loss of information. I do not advise you to
follow this solution.
A second and better solution is to utilize the average uniqueness, I−1 ∑I
i=1̄ ui, to
reduce the undue influence of outcomes that contain redundant information. Accord-
ingly, we could sample only a fraction out['tW'].mean() of the observations, or
a small multiple of that. In sklearn, the sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassiﬁer
class
accepts
an
argument
max_samples,
which
can
be
set
to
max_samples=out['tW'].mean(). In this way, we enforce that the in-bag
observations are not sampled at a frequency much higher than their uniqueness.
Random forests do not offer that max_samples functionality, however, a solution
is to bag a large number of decision trees. We will discuss this solution further in
Chapter 6.
4.5.1
Sequential Bootstrap
A third and better solution is to perform a sequential bootstrap, where draws are made
according to a changing probability that controls for redundancy. Rao et al. [1997]
propose sequential resampling with replacement until K distinct original observa-
tions appear. Although interesting, their scheme does not fully apply to our financial
problem. In the following sections we introduce an alternative method that addresses
directly the problem of overlapping outcomes.
First, an observation Xi is drawn from a uniform distribution, i ∼U [1, I], that
is, the probability of drawing any particular value i is originally 𝛿(1)
i
= I−1. For the
second draw, we wish to reduce the probability of drawing an observation Xj with
a highly overlapping outcome. Remember, a bootstrap allows sampling with repeti-
tion, so it is still possible to draw Xi again, but we wish to reduce its likelihood, since
there is an overlap (in fact, a perfect overlap) between Xi and itself. Let us denote as
𝜑the sequence of draws so far, which may include repetitions. Until now, we know
that 𝜑(1) = {i}. The uniqueness of j at time t is u(2)
t,j = 1t,j
(
1 + ∑
k∈𝜑(1) 1t,k
)−1
, as
that is the uniqueness that results from adding alternative j’s to the existing sequence
of draws 𝜑(1). The average uniqueness of j is the average u(2)
t,j over j’s lifespan,

have taken place. This sequential bootstrap scheme has the advantage that overlaps
(even repetitions) are still possible, but decreasingly likely. The sequential bootstrap
sample will be much closer to IID than samples drawn from the standard bootstrap
method. This can be verified by measuring an increase in I−1 ∑I
i=1̄ ui, relative to the
standard bootstrap method.

Implementation of Sequential Bootstrap
Snippet 4.3 derives an indicator matrix from two arguments: the index of bars
(barIx), and the pandas Series t1, which we used multiple times in Chapter 3. As
a reminder, t1 is defined by an index containing the time at which the features are
observed, and a values array containing the time at which the label is determined. The
output of this function is a binary matrix indicating what (price) bars influence the
label for each observation.

Snippet 4.4 returns the average uniqueness of each observed feature. The input is

The procedure starts with 𝜑(0) = ∅, and a uniform distribution of probability,
𝛿i = 1
3, ∀i = 1, 2, 3. Suppose that we randomly draw a number from {1, 2, 3}, and
2 is selected. Before we make a second draw on {1, 2, 3} (remember, a bootstrap
samples with repetition), we need to adjust the probabilities. The set of observa-
tions drawn so far is 𝜑(1) = {2}. The average uniqueness for the first feature is̄ u(2)

. Two points are worth men-
tioning: (1) The lowest probability goes to the feature that was picked in the first draw,
as that would exhibit the highest overlap; and (2) among the two possible draws out-
side 𝜑(1), the greater probability goes to 𝛿(2)
3 , as that is the label with no overlap to
𝜑(1). Suppose that the second draw selects number 3. We leave as an exercise the
update of the probabilities 𝛿(3) for the third and final draw. Snippet 4.6 runs a sequen-
tial bootstrap on the {1t,i
} indicator matrix in this example.

Monte Carlo Experiments
We can evaluate the efficiency of the sequential bootstrap algorithm through experi-
mental methods. Snippet 4.7 lists the function that generates a random t1 series for a
number of observations numObs (I). Each observation is made at a random number,
drawn from a uniform distribution, with boundaries 0 and numBars, where numBars
is the number of bars (T). The number of bars spanned by the observation is deter-
mined by drawing a random number from a uniform distribution with boundaries 0
and maxH.

for i in xrange(numObs):

Snippet 4.8 takes that random t1 series, and derives the implied indicator matrix,
indM. This matrix is then subjected to two procedures. In the first one, we derive the
average uniqueness from a standard bootstrap (random sampling with replacement).
In the second one, we derive the average uniqueness by applying our sequential boot-
strap algorithm. Results are reported as a dictionary.

These operations have to be repeated over a large number of iterations. Snippet 4.9
implements this Monte Carlo using the multiprocessing techniques discussed in
Chapter 20. For example, it will take about 6 hours for a 24-cores server to carry out
a Monte Carlo of 1E6 iterations, where numObs=10, numBars=100, and maxH=5.
Without parallelization, a similar Monte Carlo experiment would have taken about
6 days.

Figure 4.2 plots the histogram of the uniqueness from standard bootstrapped sam-
ples (left) and the sequentially bootstrapped samples (right). The median of the
average uniqueness for the standard method is 0.6, and the median of the average
uniqueness for the sequential method is 0.7. An ANOVA test on the difference of
means returns a vanishingly small probability. Statistically speaking, samples from
the sequential bootstrap method have an expected uniqueness that exceeds that of the
standard bootstrap method, at any reasonable confidence level.

RETURN ATTRIBUTION
In the previous section we learned a method to bootstrap samples closer to IID. In
this section we will introduce a method to weight those samples for the purpose of
training an ML algorithm. Highly overlapping outcomes would have disproportionate
weights if considered equal to non-overlapping outcomes. At the same time, labels
associated with large absolute returns should be given more importance than labels

## Page 96

RETURN ATTRIBUTION
69
with negligible absolute returns. In short, we need to weight observations by some
function of both uniqueness and absolute return.
When labels are a function of the return sign ({−1, 1} for standard labeling or
{0, 1} for meta-labeling), the sample weights can be defined in terms of the sum of
the attributed returns over the event’s lifespan, [ti,0, ti,1
],̃
wi =
||||||
ti,1
∑
t=ti,0
rt−1,t
ct
||||||
wi =̃ wiI
( I∑
j=1̃
wj
)−1
hence ∑I
i=1 wi = I. We have scaled these weights to add up to I, since libraries
(including sklearn) usually define algorithmic parameters assuming a default weight
of 1.
The rationale for this method is that we wish to weight an observation as a function
of the absolute log returns that can be attributed uniquely to it. However, this method
will not work if there is a “neutral” (return below threshold) case. For that case, lower
returns should be assigned higher weights, not the reciprocal. The “neutral” case is
unnecessary, as it can be implied by a “−1” or “1” prediction with low confidence.
This is one of several reasons I would generally advise you to drop “neutral” cases.
Snippet 4.10 implements this method.

TIME DECAY
Markets are adaptive systems (Lo [2017]). As markets evolve, older examples are
less relevant than the newer ones. Consequently, we would typically like sample
weights to decay as new observations arrive. Let d [x] ≥0, ∀x ∈
[
0, ∑I
i=1̄ ui
]
be the
time-decay factors that will multiply the sample weights derived in the previous sec-
tion. The final weight has no decay, d
[∑I
i=1̄ ui
]
= 1, and all other weights will be
adjusted relative to that. Let c ∈(−1 , 1] be a user-defined parameter that determines
the decay function as follows: For c ∈[0, 1], then d [1] = c, with linear decay; for c ∈
(−1, 0), then d
[
−c ∑I
i=1̄ ui
]
= 0, with linear decay between
[
−c ∑I
i=1̄ ui, ∑I
i=1̄ ui
]
and d [x] = 0 ∀x ≤−c ∑I
i=1̄ ui. For a linear piecewise function d = max {0, a + bx},
such requirements are met by the following boundary conditions:
1. d = a + b ∑I
i=1̄ ui = 1 ⇒a = 1 −b ∑I
i=1̄ ui.
2. Contingent on c:
(a) d = a + b0 = c ⇒b = (1 −c)
(∑I
i=1̄ ui
)−1
, ∀c ∈[0, 1]
(b) d = a −bc ∑I
i=1̄ ui = 0 ⇒b =
[
(c + 1) ∑I
i=1̄ ui
]−1
, ∀c ∈(−1, 0)
Snippet 4.11 implements this form of time-decay factors. Note that time is not
meant to be chronological. In this implementation, decay takes place according
to cumulative uniqueness, x ∈
[
0, ∑I
i=1̄ ui
]
, because a chronological decay would
reduce weights too fast in the presence of redundant observations.
SNIPPET 4.11
IMPLEMENTATION OF TIME-DECAY FACTORS
def getTimeDecay(tW,clfLastW=1.):
# apply piecewise-linear decay to observed uniqueness (tW)
# newest observation gets weight=1, oldest observation gets weight=clfLastW
clfW=tW.sort_index().cumsum()
if clfLastW>=0:slope=(1.-clfLastW)/clfW.iloc[-1]
else:slope=1./((clfLastW+1)*clfW.iloc[-1])
const=1.-slope*clfW.iloc[-1]
clfW=const+slope*clfW
clfW[clfW<0]=0
print const,slope
return clfW
It is worth discussing a few interesting cases:
r c = 1 means that there is no time decay.
r 0 < c < 1 means that weights decay linearly over time, but every observation
still receives a strictly positive weight, regardless of how old.

r c = 0 means that weights converge linearly to zero, as they become older.
r c < 0 means that the oldest portion cT of the observations receive zero weight
(i.e., they are erased from memory).
Figure 4.3 shows the decayed weights, out['w']*df, after applying the decay
factors for c ∈{1, .75, .5, 0, −.25, −.5}. Although not necessarily practical, the pro-
cedure allows the possibility of generating weights that increase as they get older, by
setting c > 1.
4.8
CLASS WEIGHTS
In addition to sample weights, it is often useful to apply class weights. Class weights
are weights that correct for underrepresented labels. This is particularly critical in
classification problems where the most important classes have rare occurrences (King
and Zeng [2001]). For example, suppose that you wish to predict liquidity crisis,
like the flash crash of May 6, 2010. These events are rare relative to the millions of
observations that take place in between them. Unless we assign higher weights to
the samples associated with those rare labels, the ML algorithm will maximize the
accuracy of the most common labels, and flash crashes will be deemed to be outliers
rather than rare events.
ML libraries typically implement functionality to handle class weights. For exam-
ple, sklearn penalizes errors in samples of class[j], j=1,…,J, with weighting
class_weight[j] rather than 1. Accordingly, higher class weights on label j will
force the algorithm to achieve higher accuracy on j. When class weights do not add up
to J, the effect is equivalent to changing the regularization parameter of the classifier.

## Page 99

72
SAMPLE WEIGHTS
In financial applications, the standard labels of a classification algorithm
are {−1, 1}, where the zero (or neutral) case will be implied by a predic-
tion with probability only slightly above 0.5 and below some neutral thresh-
old. There is no reason for favoring accuracy of one class over the other,
and as such a good default is to assign class_weight='balanced'. This
choice re-weights observations so as to simulate that all classes appeared with
equal frequency. In the context of bagging classifiers, you may want to con-
sider the argument class_weight='balanced_subsample', which means that
class_weight='balanced' will be applied to the in-bag bootstrapped samples,
rather than to the entire dataset. For full details, it is helpful to read the source code
implementing class_weight in sklearn. Please also be aware of this reported bug:

tick data.

outcomes at each point in time.
(c) Plot the time series of the number of concurrent labels on the primary axis,
and the time series of exponentially weighted moving standard deviation of
returns on the secondary axis.
(d) Produce a scatterplot of the number of concurrent labels (x-axis) and the
exponentially weighted moving standard deviation of returns (y-axis). Can
you appreciate a relationship?

(b) What is the mean accuracy of k-fold cross-validation (without shuffling) on
the same dataset?
(c) Why is out-of-bag accuracy so much higher than cross-validation accuracy?
Which one is more correct / less biased? What is the source of this bias?
4.4 Modify the code in Section 4.7 to apply an exponential time-decay factor.

CHAPTER 5
Fractionally Differentiated Features
5.1
MOTIVATION
It is known that, as a consequence of arbitrage forces, financial series exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios (L´opez de Prado [2015]). To make matters worse, standard sta-
tionarity transformations, like integer differentiation, further reduce that signal by
removing memory. Price series have memory, because every value is dependent upon
a long history of previous levels. In contrast, integer differentiated series, like returns,
have a memory cut-off, in the sense that history is disregarded entirely after a finite
sample window. Once stationarity transformations have wiped out all memory from
the data, statisticians resort to complex mathematical techniques to extract what-
ever residual signal remains. Not surprisingly, applying these complex techniques on
memory-erased series likely leads to false discoveries. In this chapter we introduce a
data transformation method that ensures the stationarity of the data while preserving
as much memory as possible.
5.2
THE STATIONARITY VS. MEMORY DILEMMA
It is common in finance to find non-stationary time series. What makes these series
non-stationary is the presence of memory, i.e., a long history of previous levels that
shift the series’ mean over time. In order to perform inferential analyses, researchers
need to work with invariant processes, such as returns on prices (or changes in log-
prices), changes in yield, or changes in volatility. These data transformations make
the series stationary, at the expense of removing all memory from the original series
(Alexander [2001], chapter 11). Although stationarity is a necessary property for
inferential purposes, it is rarely the case in signal processing that we wish all mem-
ory to be erased, as that memory is the basis for the model’s predictive power. For
example, equilibrium (stationary) models need some memory to assess how far the
75

## Page 103

FRACTIONALLY DIFFERENTIATED FEATURES
price process has drifted away from the long-term expected value in order to gen-
erate a forecast. The dilemma is that returns are stationary, however memory-less,
and prices have memory, however they are non-stationary. The question arises: What
is the minimum amount of differentiation that makes a price series stationary while
preserving as much memory as possible? Accordingly, we would like to generalize
the notion of returns to consider stationary series where not all memory is erased.
Under this framework, returns are just one kind of (and in most cases suboptimal)
price transformation among many other possibilities.
Part of the importance of cointegration methods is their ability to model series with
memory. But why would the particular case of zero differentiation deliver best out-
comes? Zero differentiation is as arbitrary as 1-step differentiation. There is a wide
region between these two extremes (fully differentiated series on one hand, and zero
differentiated series on the other) that can be explored through fractional differentia-
tion for the purpose of developing a highly predictive ML model.
Supervised learning algorithms typically require stationary features. The reason
is that we need to map a previously unseen (unlabeled) observation to a collection
of labeled examples, and infer from them the label of that new observation. If the
features are not stationary, we cannot map the new observation to a large number of
known examples. But stationarity does not ensure predictive power. Stationarity is a
necessary, non-sufficient condition for the high performance of an ML algorithm. The
problem is, there is a trade-off between stationarity and memory. We can always make
a series more stationary through differentiation, but it will be at the cost of erasing
some memory, which will defeat the forecasting purpose of the ML algorithm. In this
chapter, we will study one way to resolve this dilemma.
5.3
LITERATURE REVIEW
Virtually all the financial time series literature is based on the premise of making
non-stationary series stationary through integer transformation (see Hamilton [1994]
for an example). This raises two questions: (1) Why would integer 1 differentia-
tion (like the one used for computing returns on log-prices) be optimal? (2) Is over-
differentiation one reason why the literature has been so biased in favor of the efficient
markets hypothesis?
The notion of fractional differentiation applied to the predictive time series analy-
sis dates back at least to Hosking [1981]. In that paper, a family of ARIMA processes
was generalized by permitting the degree of differencing to take fractional values.
This was useful because fractionally differenced processes exhibit long-term persis-
tence and antipersistence, hence enhancing the forecasting power compared to the
standard ARIMA approach. In the same paper, Hosking states: “Apart from a passing
reference by Granger (1978), fractional differencing does not appear to have been
previously mentioned in connection with time series analysis.”
After Hosking’s paper, the literature on this subject has been surprisingly scarce,
adding up to eight journal articles written by only nine authors: Hosking, Johansen,
Nielsen, MacKinnon, Jensen, Jones, Popiel, Cavaliere, and Taylor. See the references
for details. Most of those papers relate to technical matters, such as fast algorithms for

the calculation of fractional differentiation in continuous stochastic processes (e.g.,
Jensen and Nielsen [2014]).
Differentiating the stochastic process is a computationally expensive operation.
In this chapter we will take a practical, alternative, and novel approach to recover
stationarity: We will generalize the difference operator to non-integer steps.

where BkXt = Xt−k for any integer k ≥0. For example, (1 −B)2 = 1 −2B + B2,
where B2Xt = Xt−2, so that (1 −B)2Xt = Xt −2Xt−1 + Xt−2. Note that (x + y)n =

Iterative Estimation
Looking at the sequence of weights, 𝜔, we can appreciate that for k = 0, … , ∞, with
𝜔0 = 1, the weights can be generated iteratively as:
𝜔k = −𝜔k−1
d −k + 1
k
Figure 5.1 plots the sequence of weights used to compute each value of the frac-
tionally differentiated series. The legend reports the value of d used to generate each
sequence, the x-axis indicates the value of k, and the y-axis shows the value of 𝜔k.
For example, for d = 0, all weights are 0 except for 𝜔0 = 1. That is the case where
the differentiated series coincides with the original one. For d = 1, all weights are 0
except for 𝜔0 = 1 and 𝜔1 = −1. That is the standard first-order integer differentia-
tion, which is used to derive log-price returns. Anywhere in between these two cases,
all weights after 𝜔0 = 1 are negative and greater than −1.
Figure 5.2 plots the sequence of weights where d ∈[1, 2], at increments of 0.1.
For d > 1, we observe 𝜔1 < −1 and 𝜔k > 0, ∀k ≥2.
Snippet 5.1 lists the code used to generate these plots.

Let us consider the convergence of the weights. From the above result, we can see
that for k > d, if 𝜔k−1 ≠0, then ||||

𝜔k−1
||||
= |||
d−k+1
k
||| < 1, and 𝜔k = 0 otherwise. Conse-
quently, the weights converge asymptotically to zero, as an infinite product of factors
within the unit circle. Also, for a positive d and k < d + 1, we have d−k+1
k
≥0, which
makes the initial weights alternate in sign. For a non-integer d, once k ≥d + 1, 𝜔k
will be negative if int[d] is even, and positive otherwise. Summarizing, lim
k→∞𝜔k = 0−
(converges to zero from the left) when int[d] is even, and lim
k→∞𝜔k = 0+ (converges to
zero from the right) when Int[d] is odd. In the special case d ∈(0, 1), this means
that −1 < 𝜔k < 0, ∀k > 0. This alternation of weight signs is necessary to make
{̃Xt}t=1,.…,T stationary, as memory wanes or is offset over the long run.
5.5
IMPLEMENTATION
In this section we will explore two alternative implementations of fractional differ-
entiation: the standard “expanding window” method, and a new method that I call
“fixed-width window fracdiff” (FFD).
5.5.1
Expanding Window
Let us discuss how to fractionally differentiate a (finite) time series in practice. Sup-
pose a time series with T real observations, {Xt}, t = 1, … , T. Because of data limita-
tions, the fractionally differentiated valuẽ XT cannot be computed on an infinite series
of weights. For instance, the last point̃ XT will use weights {𝜔k}, k = 0, … , T −1,
and̃ XT−l will use weights {𝜔k}, k = 0, … , T −l −1. This means that the initial
points will have a different amount of memory compared to the final points. For each
l, we can determine the relative weight-loss, 𝜆l =
∑T
j=T−l |𝜔j|
∑T−1
i=0 |𝜔i| . Given a tolerance level
𝜏∈[0, 1], we can determine the value l∗such that 𝜆l∗≤𝜏and 𝜆l∗+1 > 𝜏. This value
l∗corresponds to the first results {̃Xt}t=1,…,l∗where the weight-loss is beyond the
acceptable threshold, 𝜆t > 𝜏(e.g., 𝜏= 0.01).
From our earlier discussion, it is clear that 𝜆l∗depends on the convergence speed
of {𝜔k}, which in turn depends on d ∈[0, 1]. For d = 1, 𝜔k = 0, ∀k > 1, and 𝜆l =
0, ∀l > 1, hence it suffices to drop̃ X1. As d →0+, l∗increases, and a larger portion
of the initial {̃Xt}t=1,…,l∗needs to be dropped in order to keep the weight-loss 𝜆l∗≤𝜏.
Figure 5.3 plots the E-mini S&P 500 futures trade bars of size 1E4, rolled forward,
fractionally differentiated, with parameters (d = .4, 𝜏= 1) on the top and parameters
(d = .4, 𝜏= 1E −2) on the bottom.
The negative drift in both plots is caused by the negative weights that are added
to the initial observations as the window is expanded. When we do not control for
weight loss, the negative drift is extreme, to the point that only that trend is visi-
ble. The negative drift is somewhat more moderate in the right plot, after controlling

for the weight loss, however, it is still substantial, because values {̃Xt}t=l∗+1,…,T are
computed on an expanding window. This problem can be corrected by a fixed-width
window, implemented in Snippet 5.2.

5.5.2
Fixed-Width Window Fracdiff
Alternatively, fractional differentiation can be computed using a fixed-width window,
that is, dropping the weights after their modulus (|𝜔k|) falls below a given threshold
value (𝜏). This is equivalent to finding the first l∗such that |𝜔l∗| ≥𝜏and |𝜔l∗+1| ≤𝜏,
setting a new variablẽ 𝜔k̃
𝜔k =
{
𝜔k
if k ≤l∗

if k > l∗
and̃ Xt = ∑l∗

500 futures trade bars of size 1E4, rolled forward, fractionally differentiated
(d = .4, 𝜏= 1E −5).
This procedure has the advantage that the same vector of weights is used
across all estimates of {̃Xt}t=l∗,…,T, hence avoiding the negative drift caused by an

STATIONARITY WITH MAXIMUM MEMORY PRESERVATION
Consider a series {Xt}t=1,…,T. Applying the fixed-width window fracdiff (FFD)
method on this series, we can compute the minimum coefficient d∗such that the
resulting fractionally differentiated series {̃Xt}t=l∗,…,T is stationary. This coefficient
d∗quantifies the amount of memory that needs to be removed to achieve stationar-
ity. If {Xt}t=l∗,…,T is already stationary, then d∗= 0. If {Xt}t=l∗,…,T contains a unit
root, then d∗< 1. If {Xt}t=l∗,…,T exhibits explosive behavior (like in a bubble), then
d∗> 1. A case of particular interest is 0 < d∗≪1, when the original series is “mildly
non-stationary.” In this case, although differentiation is needed, a full integer differ-
entiation removes excessive memory (and predictive power).
Figure 5.5 illustrates this concept. On the right y-axis, it plots the ADF statistic
computed on E-mini S&P 500 futures log-prices, rolled forward using the ETF trick

(see Chapter 2), downsampled to daily frequency, going back to the contract’s incep-
tion. On the x-axis, it displays the d value used to generate the series on which the
ADF statistic was computed. The original series has an ADF statistic of –0.3387,
while the returns series has an ADF statistic of –46.9114. At a 95% confidence level,
the test’s critical value is –2.8623. The ADF statistic crosses that threshold in the
vicinity of d = 0.35. The left y-axis plots the correlation between the original series
(d = 0) and the differentiated series at various d values. At d = 0.35 the correlation
is still very high, at 0.995. This confirms that the procedure introduced in this chapter
has been successful in achieving stationarity without giving up too much memory. In
contrast, the correlation between the original series and the returns series is only 0.03,
hence showing that the standard integer differentiation wipes out the series’ memory
almost entirely.
Virtually all finance papers attempt to recover stationarity by applying an integer
differentiation d = 1 ≫0.35, which means that most studies have over-differentiated
the series, that is, they have removed much more memory than was necessary to
satisfy standard econometric assumptions. Snippet 5.4 lists the code used to produce
these results.

The example on E-mini futures is by no means an exception. Table 5.1 shows the
ADF statistics after applying FFD(d) on various values of d, for 87 of the most liquid
futures worldwide. In all cases, the standard d = 1 used for computing returns implies
over-differentiation. In fact, in all cases stationarity is achieved with d < 0.6. In some
cases, like orange juice (JO1 Comdty) or live cattle (LC1 Comdty) no differentiation
at all was needed.

CONCLUSION
To summarize, most econometric analyses follow one of two paradigms:
1. Box-Jenkins: Returns are stationary, however memory-less.
2. Engle-Granger: Log-prices have memory, however they are non-stationary.
Cointegration is the trick that makes regression work on non-stationary series,
so that memory is preserved. However the number of cointegrated variables is
limited, and the cointegrating vectors are notoriously unstable.
In contrast, the FFD approach introduced in this chapter shows that there is no
need to give up all of the memory in order to gain stationarity. And there is no need
for the cointegration trick as it relates to ML forecasting. Once you become familiar
with FFD, it will allow you to achieve stationarity without renouncing to memory (or
predictive power).
In practice, I suggest you experiment with the following transformation of your
features: First, compute a cumulative sum of the time series. This guarantees that
some order of differentiation is needed. Second, compute the FFD(d) series for var-
ious d ∈[0, 1]. Third, determine the minimum d such that the p-value of the ADF
statistic on FFD(d) falls below 5%. Fourth, use the FFD(d) series as your predictive
feature.

Ensemble Methods
6.1
MOTIVATION
In this chapter we will discuss two of the most popular ML ensemble methods.1 In the
references and footnotes you will find books and articles that introduce these tech-
niques. As everywhere else in this book, the assumption is that you have already used
these approaches. The goal of this chapter is to explain what makes them effective,
and how to avoid common errors that lead to their misuse in finance.
6.2
THE THREE SOURCES OF ERRORS
ML models generally suffer from three errors:2
1. Bias: This error is caused by unrealistic assumptions. When bias is high, the
ML algorithm has failed to recognize important relations between features and
outcomes. In this situation, the algorithm is said to be “underfit.”
2. Variance: This error is caused by sensitivity to small changes in the training
set. When variance is high, the algorithm has overfit the training set, and that
is why even minimal changes in the training set can produce wildly different
predictions. Rather than modelling the general patterns in the training set, the
algorithm has mistaken noise with signal.

3. Noise: This error is caused by the variance of the observed values, like unpre-
dictable changes or measurement errors. This is the irreducible error, which
cannot be explained by any model.
Consider a training set of observations {xi}i=1,…,n and real-valued outcomes
{yi}i=1,…,n. Suppose a function f[x] exists, such that y = f[x] + 𝜀, where 𝜀is white
noise with E[𝜀i] = 0 and E[𝜀2
i ] = 𝜎2
𝜀. We would like to estimate the function̂ f[x]
that best fits f[x], in the sense of making the variance of the estimation error
E[(yi −̂ f[xi])
2] minimal (the mean squared error cannot be zero, because of the noise
represented by 𝜎2
𝜀). This mean-squared error can be decomposed as

An ensemble method is a method that combines a set of weak learners, all based
on the same learning algorithm, in order to create a (stronger) learner that performs
better than any of the individual ones. Ensemble methods help reduce bias and/or
variance.
6.3
BOOTSTRAP AGGREGATION
Bootstrap aggregation (bagging) is an effective way of reducing the variance in fore-
casts. It works as follows: First, generate N training datasets by random sampling with
replacement. Second, fit N estimators, one on each training set. These estimators are
fit independently from each other, hence the models can be fit in parallel. Third, the
ensemble forecast is the simple average of the individual forecasts from the N models.
In the case of categorical variables, the probability that an observation belongs to a
class is given by the proportion of estimators that classify that observation as a mem-
ber of that class (majority voting). When the base estimator can make forecasts with
a prediction probability, the bagging classifier may derive a mean of the probabilities.
If you use sklearn’s BaggingClassiﬁer class to compute the out-of-bag
accuracy, you should be aware of this bug: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-
learn/issues/8933. One workaround is to rename the labels in integer sequential
order.
6.3.1
Variance Reduction
Bagging’s main advantage is that it reduces forecasts’ variance, hence helping address
overfitting. The variance of the bagged prediction (𝜑i[c]) is a function of the number
of bagged estimators (N), the average variance of a single estimator’s prediction (̄𝜎),

(Chapter 4) is to produce samples as independent as possible, thereby reducinḡ 𝜌,

6.3.2
Improved Accuracy
Consider a bagging classifier that makes a prediction on k classes by majority voting
among N independent classifiers. We can label the predictions as {0,1}, where 1
means a correct prediction. The accuracy of a classifier is the probability p of labeling
a prediction as 1. On average we will get Np predictions labeled as 1, with variance
Np(1 −p). Majority voting makes the correct prediction when the most forecasted
class is observed. For example, for N = 10 and k = 3, the bagging classifier made
a correct prediction when class A was observed and the cast votes were [A, B, C] =
[4,3,3]. However, the bagging classifier made an incorrect prediction when class
A was observed and the cast votes were [A, B, C] = [4,1,5]. A sufficient condition
is that the sum of these labels is X > N
2 . A necessary (non-sufficient) condition is
that X > N
k , which occurs with probability

The implication is that for a sufficiently large N, say N > p(p −1∕k)−2, then
p > 1
k ⇒P[X > N
k ] > p, hence the bagging classifier’s accuracy exceeds the average
accuracy of the individual classifiers. Snippet 6.1 implements this calculation.

This is a strong argument in favor of bagging any classifier in general, when
computational requirements permit it. However, unlike boosting, bagging cannot
improve the accuracy of poor classifiers: If the individual learners are poor classifiers
(p ≪1
k), majority voting will still perform poorly (although with lower variance).
Figure 6.2 illustrates these facts. Because it is easier to achievē 𝜌≪1 than p > 1
k,
bagging is more likely to be successful in reducing variance than in reducing bias.
For further analysis on this topic, the reader is directed to Condorcet’s Jury Theo-
rem. Although the theorem is derived for the purposes of majority voting in political

science, the problem addressed by this theorem shares similarities with the above
discussion.
6.3.3
Observation Redundancy
In Chapter 4 we studied one reason why financial observations cannot be assumed to
be IID. Redundant observations have two detrimental effects on bagging. First, the
samples drawn with replacement are more likely to be virtually identical, even if they
do not share the same observations. This makes̄ 𝜌≈1, and bagging will not reduce
variance, regardless of N. For example, if each observation at t is labeled according
to the return between t and t + 100, we should sample 1% of the observations per
bagged estimator, but not more. Chapter 4, Section 4.5 recommended three alternative
solutions, one of which consisted of setting max_samples=out['tW'].mean() in
sklearn’s implementation of the bagging classifier class. Another (better) solution
was to apply the sequential bootstrap method.
The second detrimental effect from observation redundancy is that out-of-bag
accuracy will be inflated. This happens because random sampling with replacement
places in the training set samples that are very similar to those out-of-bag. In
such a case, a proper stratified k-fold cross-validation without shuffling before
partitioning will show a much lower testing-set accuracy than the one estimated
out-of-bag. For this reason, it is advisable to set StratiﬁedKFold(n_splits=k,
shufﬂe=False) when using that sklearn class, cross-validate the bagging classifier,
and ignore the out-of-bag accuracy results. A low number k is preferred to a high

one, as excessive partitioning would again place in the testing set samples too similar
to those used in the training set.
6.4
RANDOM FOREST
Decision trees are known to be prone to overfitting, which increases the variance of
the forecasts.3 In order to address this concern, the random forest (RF) method was
designed to produce ensemble forecasts with lower variance.
RF shares some similarities with bagging, in the sense of training independently
individual estimators over bootstrapped subsets of the data. The key difference with
bagging is that random forests incorporate a second level of randomness: When
optimizing each node split, only a random subsample (without replacement) of the
attributes will be evaluated, with the purpose of further decorrelating the estimators.
Like bagging, RF reduces forecasts’ variance without overfitting (remember, as
long as̄ 𝜌< 1). A second advantage is that RF evaluates feature importance, which
we will discuss in depth in Chapter 8. A third advantage is that RF provides out-of-bag
accuracy estimates, however in financial applications they are likely to be inflated (as
discussed in Section 6.3.3). But like bagging, RF will not necessarily exhibit lower
bias than individual decision trees.
If a large number of samples are redundant (non-IID), overfitting will still take
place: Sampling randomly with replacement will build a large number of essen-
tially identical trees (̄𝜌≈1), where each decision tree is overfit (a flaw for which
decision trees are notorious). Unlike bagging, RF always fixes the size of the boot-
strapped samples to match the size of the training dataset. Let us review ways
we can address this RF overfitting problem in sklearn. For illustration purposes,
I will refer to sklearn’s classes; however, these solutions can be applied to any
implementation:
1. Set a parameter max_features to a lower value, as a way of forcing discrep-
ancy between trees.
2. Early stopping: Set the regularization parameter min_weight_fraction_
leaf to a sufficiently large value (e.g., 5%) such that out-of-bag accuracy con-
verges to out-of-sample (k-fold) accuracy.
3. Use
BaggingClassiﬁer
on
DecisionTreeClassiﬁer
where
max_
samples is set to the average uniqueness (avgU) between samples.
(a) clf=DecisionTreeClassiﬁer(criterion='entropy',max_
features='auto',class_weight='balanced')
(b) bc=BaggingClassiﬁer(base_estimator=clf,n_estimators=
1000,max_samples=avgU,max_features=1.)
4. Use

5. Modify the RF class to replace standard bootstrapping with sequential boot-
strapping.
In summary, Snippet 6.2 demonstrates three alternative ways of setting up an RF,
using different classes.

THREE WAYS OF SETTING UP AN RF

clf1=BaggingClassiﬁer(base_estimator=clf1,n_estimators=1000,max_samples=avgU)

class_weight='balanced_subsample')
clf2=BaggingClassiﬁer(base_estimator=clf2,n_estimators=1000,max_samples=avgU,
max_features=1.)
When fitting decision trees, a rotation of the features space in a direction that
aligns with the axes typically reduces the number of levels needed by the tree. For this
reason, I suggest you fit RF on a PCA of the features, as that may speed up calculations
and reduce some overfitting (more on this in Chapter 8). Also, as discussed in Chapter
4, Section 4.8, class_weight='balanced_subsample' will help you prevent the
trees from misclassifying minority classes.
6.5
BOOSTING
Kearns and Valiant [1989] were among the first to ask whether one could combine
weak estimators in order to achieve one with high accuracy. Shortly after, Schapire
[1990] demonstrated that the answer to that question was affirmative, using the pro-
cedure we today call boosting. In general terms, it works as follows: First, generate
one training set by random sampling with replacement, according to some sample
weights (initialized with uniform weights). Second, fit one estimator using that train-
ing set. Third, if the single estimator achieves an accuracy greater than the acceptance
threshold (e.g., 50% in a binary classifier, so that it performs better than chance), the
estimator is kept, otherwise it is discarded. Fourth, give more weight to misclassified
observations, and less weight to correctly classified observations. Fifth, repeat the
previous steps until N estimators are produced. Sixth, the ensemble forecast is the
weighted average of the individual forecasts from the N models, where the weights

are determined by the accuracy of the individual estimators. There are many boosting
algorithms, of which AdaBoost is one of the most popular (Geron [2017]). Figure 6.3
summarizes the decision flow of a standard AdaBoost implementation.

BAGGING VS. BOOSTING IN FINANCE
From the above description, a few aspects make boosting quite different from
bagging:4
r Individual classifiers are fit sequentially.
r Poor-performing classifiers are dismissed.

r Observations are weighted differently in each iteration.
r The ensemble forecast is a weighted average of the individual learners.
Boosting’s main advantage is that it reduces both variance and bias in forecasts.
However, correcting bias comes at the cost of greater risk of overfitting. It could
be argued that in financial applications bagging is generally preferable to boost-
ing. Bagging addresses overfitting, while boosting addresses underfitting. Overfit-
ting is often a greater concern than underfitting, as it is not difficult to overfit an
ML algorithm to financial data, because of the low signal-to-noise ratio. Further-
more, bagging can be parallelized, while generally boosting requires sequential
running.
6.7
BAGGING FOR SCALABILITY
As you know, several popular ML algorithms do not scale well with the sample size.
Support vector machines (SVMs) are a prime example. If you attempt to fit an SVM
on a million observations, it may take a while until the algorithm converges. And even
once it has converged, there is no guarantee that the solution is a global optimum, or
that it is not overfit.
One practical approach is to build a bagging algorithm, where the base estima-
tor belongs to a class that does not scale well with the sample size, like SVM.
When defining that base estimator, we will impose a tight early stopping condition.
For example, in sklearn’s SVM implementation, you could set a low value for the
max_iter parameter, say 1E5 iterations. The default value is max_iter=-1, which
tells the estimator to continue performing iterations until errors fall below a toler-
ance level. Alternatively, you could raise the tolerance level through the parame-
ter tol, which has a default value tol=1E-3. Either of these two parameters will
force an early stop. You can stop other algorithms early with equivalent parameters,
like the number of levels in an RF (max_depth), or the minimum weighted fraction
of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node
(min_weight_fraction_leaf).
Given that bagging algorithms can be parallelized, we are transforming a large
sequential task into many smaller ones that are run simultaneously. Of course, the
early stopping will increase the variance of the outputs from the individual base esti-
mators; however, that increase can be more than offset by the variance reduction asso-
ciated with the bagging algorithm. You can control that reduction by adding more
independent base estimators. Used in this way, bagging will allow you to achieve fast
and robust estimates on extremely large datasets.

6.1 Why is bagging based on random sampling with replacement? Would bagging
still reduce a forecast’s variance if sampling were without replacement?

CHAPTER 7
Cross-Validation in Finance
7.1
MOTIVATION
The purpose of cross-validation (CV) is to determine the generalization error of an
ML algorithm, so as to prevent overfitting. CV is yet another instance where stan-
dard ML techniques fail when applied to financial problems. Overfitting will take
place, and CV will not be able to detect it. In fact, CV will contribute to overfitting
through hyper-parameter tuning. In this chapter we will learn why standard CV fails
in finance, and what can be done about it.
7.2
THE GOAL OF CROSS-VALIDATION
One of the purposes of ML is to learn the general structure of the data, so that we
can produce predictions on future, unseen features. When we test an ML algorithm
on the same dataset as was used for training, not surprisingly, we achieve spectacular
results. When ML algorithms are misused that way, they are no different from file
lossy-compression algorithms: They can summarize the data with extreme fidelity,
yet with zero forecasting power.
CV splits observations drawn from an IID process into two sets: the training set
and the testing set. Each observation in the complete dataset belongs to one, and only
one, set. This is done as to prevent leakage from one set into the other, since that
would defeat the purpose of testing on unseen data. Further details can be found in
the books and articles listed in the references section.
There are many alternative CV schemes, of which one of the most popular is k-
fold CV. Figure 7.1 illustrates the k train/test splits carried out by a k-fold CV, where
k = 5. In this scheme:
1. The dataset is partitioned into k subsets.
2. For i = 1,…,k

FIGURE 7.1
Train/test splits in a 5-fold CV scheme
(a) The ML algorithm is trained on all subsets excluding i.
(b) The fitted ML algorithm is tested on i.
The outcome from k-fold CV is a kx1 array of cross-validated performance met-
rics. For example, in a binary classifier, the model is deemed to have learned some-
thing if the cross-validated accuracy is over 1/2, since that is the accuracy we would
achieve by tossing a fair coin.
In finance, CV is typically used in two settings: model development (like hyper-
parameter tuning) and backtesting. Backtesting is a complex subject that we will dis-
cuss thoroughly in Chapters 10–16. In this chapter, we will focus on CV for model
development.
7.3
WHY K-FOLD CV FAILS IN FINANCE
By now you may have read quite a few papers in finance that present k-fold CV
evidence that an ML algorithm performs well. Unfortunately, it is almost certain that
those results are wrong. One reason k-fold CV fails in finance is because observations
cannot be assumed to be drawn from an IID process. A second reason for CV’s failure
is that the testing set is used multiple times in the process of developing a model,
leading to multiple testing and selection bias. We will revisit this second cause of
failure in Chapters 11–13. For the time being, let us concern ourselves exclusively
with the first cause of failure.
Leakage takes place when the training set contains information that also appears
in the testing set. Consider a serially correlated feature X that is associated with labels
Y that are formed on overlapping data:

## Page 132

A SOLUTION: PURGED K-FOLD CV
105
r Because of the serial correlation, Xt ≈Xt+1.
r Because labels are derived from overlapping datapoints, Yt ≈Yt+1.
By placing t and t + 1 in different sets, information is leaked. When a classifier
is first trained on (Xt, Yt), and then it is asked to predict E[Yt+1|Xt+1] based on an
observed Xt+1, this classifier is more likely to achieve Yt+1 = E[Yt+1|Xt+1] even if X
is an irrelevant feature.
If X is a predictive feature, leakage will enhance the performance of an already
valuable strategy. The problem is leakage in the presence of irrelevant features, as
this leads to false discoveries. There are at least two ways to reduce the likelihood of
leakage:
1. Drop from the training set any observation i where Yi is a function of informa-
tion used to determine Yj, and j belongs to the testing set.
(a) For example, Yi and Yj should not span overlapping periods (see Chapter 4
for a discussion of sample uniqueness).
2. Avoid overfitting the classifier. In this way, even if some leakage occurs, the
classifier will not be able to profit from it. Use:
(a) Early stopping of the base estimators (see Chapter 6).
(b) Bagging of classifiers, while controlling for oversampling on redundant
examples, so that the individual classifiers are as diverse as possible.
i. Set max_samples to the average uniqueness.
ii. Apply sequential bootstrap (Chapter 4).
Consider the case where Xi and Xj are formed on overlapping information, where
i belongs to the training set and j belongs to the testing set. Is this a case of informa-
tional leakage? Not necessarily, as long as Yi and Yj are independent. For leakage to
take place, it must occur that (Xi, Yi) ≈(Xj, Yj), and it does not suffice that Xi ≈Xj or
even Yi ≈Yj.
7.4
A SOLUTION: PURGED K-FOLD CV
One way to reduce leakage is to purge from the training set all observations whose
labels overlapped in time with those labels included in the testing set. I call this
process “purging.” In addition, since financial features often incorporate series that
exhibit serial correlation (like ARMA processes), we should eliminate from the train-
ing set observations that immediately follow an observation in the testing set. I call
this process “embargo.”
7.4.1
Purging the Training Set
Suppose a testing observation whose label Yj is decided based on the information set
Φj. In order to prevent the type of leakage described in the previous section, we would

## Page 133

106
CROSS-VALIDATION IN FINANCE
like to purge from the training set any observation whose label Yi is decided based on
the information set Φi, such that Φi ∩Φj = ∅.
In particular, we will determine that there is informational overlap between two
observations i and j whenever Yi and Yj are concurrent (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3),
in the sense that both labels are contingent on at least one common random draw. For
example, consider a label Yj that is a function of observations in the closed range t ∈
[tj,0, tj,1], Yj = f[[tj,0, tj,1]] (with some abuse of notation). For example, in the context
of the triple-barrier labeling method (Chapter 3), it means that the label is the sign of
the return spanning between price bars with indices tj,0 and tj,1, that is sgn[rtj,0,tj,1]. A
label Yi = f[[ti,0, ti,1]] overlaps with Yj if any of the three sufficient conditions is met:
1. tj,0 ≤ti,0 ≤tj,1
2. tj,0 ≤ti,1 ≤tj,1
3. ti,0 ≤tj,0 ≤tj,1 ≤ti,1
Snippet 7.1 implements this purging of observations from the training set. If the
testing set is contiguous, in the sense that no training observations occur between
the first and last testing observation, then purging can be accelerated: The object
testTimes can be a pandas series with a single item, spanning the entire testing
set.
SNIPPET 7.1
PURGING OBSERVATION IN THE TRAINING SET

’’’
Given testTimes, find the times of the training observations.
—t1.index: Time when the observation started.
—t1.value: Time when the observation ended.

for i,j in testTimes.iteritems():
df0=trn[(i<=trn.index)&(trn.index<=j)].index # train starts within test
df1=trn[(i<=trn)&(trn<=j)].index # train ends within test
df2=trn[(trn.index<=i)&(j<=trn)].index # train envelops test
trn=trn.drop(df0.union(df1).union(df2))
return trn
When leakage takes place, performance improves merely by increasing k →T,
where T is the number of bars. The reason is that the larger the number of testing
splits, the greater the number of overlapping observations in the training set. In many
cases, purging suffices to prevent leakage: Performance will improve as we increase
k, because we allow the model to recalibrate more often. But beyond a certain value

k∗, performance will not improve, indicating that the backtest is not profiting from
leaks. Figure 7.2 plots one partition of the k-fold CV. The test set is surrounded by
two train sets, generating two overlaps that must be purged to prevent leakage.
7.4.2
Embargo
For those cases where purging is not able to prevent all leakage, we can impose
an embargo on training observations after every test set. The embargo does not
need to affect training observations prior to a test set, because training labels Yi =
f[[ti,0, ti,1]], where ti,1 < tj,0 (training ends before testing begins), contain informa-
tion that was available at the testing time tj,0. In other words, we are only con-
cerned with training labels Yi = f[[ti,0, ti,1]] that take place immediately after the
test, tj,1 ≤ti,0 ≤tj,1 + h. We can implement this embargo period h by setting Yj =
f[[tj,0, tj,1 + h]] before purging. A small value h ≈.01T often suffices to prevent
all leakage, as can be confirmed by testing that performance does not improve
indefinitely by increasing k →T. Figure 7.3 illustrates the embargoing of train
observations immediately after the testing set. Snippet 7.2 implements the embargo
logic.

BUGS IN SKLEARN’S CROSS-VALIDATION
You would think that something as critical as cross-validation would be perfectly
implemented in one of the most popular ML libraries. Unfortunately that is not the
case, and this is one of the reasons you must always read all the code you run, and a
strong point in favor of open source. One of the many upsides of open-source code is

that you can verify everything and adjust it to your needs. Snippet 7.4 addresses two
known sklearn bugs:
1. Scoring functions do not know classes_, as a consequence of sklearn’s
reliance on numpy arrays rather than pandas series: https://github.com/scikit-
learn/scikit-learn/issues/6231
2. cross_val_score will give different results because it passes weights to
the fit method, but not to the log_loss method: https://github.com/scikit-

upon, implemented, tested, and released. Until then, you should use cvScore in Snip-

finance? What is the purpose of shuffling? Why does shuffling defeat the purpose

CHAPTER 8
Feature Importance
8.1
MOTIVATION
One of the most pervasive mistakes in financial research is to take some data, run
it through an ML algorithm, backtest the predictions, and repeat the sequence until
a nice-looking backtest shows up. Academic journals are filled with such pseudo-
discoveries, and even large hedge funds constantly fall into this trap. It does not matter
if the backtest is a walk-forward out-of-sample. The fact that we are repeating a test
over and over on the same data will likely lead to a false discovery. This methodolog-
ical error is so notorious among statisticians that they consider it scientific fraud, and
the American Statistical Association warns against it in its ethical guidelines (Amer-
ican Statistical Association [2016], Discussion #4). It typically takes about 20 such
iterations to discover a (false) investment strategy subject to the standard significance
level (false positive rate) of 5%. In this chapter we will explore why such an approach
is a waste of time and money, and how feature importance offers an alternative.
8.2
THE IMPORTANCE OF FEATURE IMPORTANCE
A striking facet of the financial industry is that so many very seasoned portfolio
managers (including many with a quantitative background) do not realize how easy
it is to overfit a backtest. How to backtest properly is not the subject of this chapter;
we will address that extremely important topic in Chapters 11–15. The goal of this
chapter is to explain one of the analyses that must be performed before any backtest
is carried out.
Suppose that you are given a pair of matrices (X, y), that respectively contain
features and labels for a particular financial instrument. We can fit a classifier on
(X, y) and evaluate the generalization error through a purged k-fold cross-validation
(CV), as we saw in Chapter 7. Suppose that we achieve good performance. The next
113

FEATURE IMPORTANCE
natural question is to try to understand what features contributed to that performance.
Maybe we could add some features that strengthen the signal responsible for the clas-
sifier’s predictive power. Maybe we could eliminate some of the features that are only
adding noise to the system. Notably, understanding feature importance opens up the
proverbial black box. We can gain insight into the patterns identified by the classifier
if we understand what source of information is indispensable to it. This is one of the
reasons why the black box mantra is somewhat overplayed by the ML skeptics. Yes,
the algorithm has learned without us directing the process (that is the whole point
of ML!) in a black box, but that does not mean that we cannot (or should not) take
a look at what the algorithm has found. Hunters do not blindly eat everything their
smart dogs retrieve for them, do they?
Once we have found what features are important, we can learn more by conducting
a number of experiments. Are these features important all the time, or only in some
specific environments? What triggers a change in importance over time? Can those
regime switches be predicted? Are those important features also relevant to other
related financial instruments? Are they relevant to other asset classes? What are the
most relevant features across all financial instruments? What is the subset of features
with the highest rank correlation across the entire investment universe? This is a much
better way of researching strategies than the foolish backtest cycle. Let me state this
maxim as one of the most critical lessons I hope you learn from this book:

BACKTESTING—IGNORE AT YOUR OWN PERIL

8.3
FEATURE IMPORTANCE WITH SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS
I find it useful to distinguish between feature importance methods based on whether
they are impacted by substitution effects. In this context, a substitution effect takes
place when the estimated importance of one feature is reduced by the presence of
other related features. Substitution effects are the ML analogue of what the statistics
and econometrics literature calls “multi-collinearity.” One way to address linear sub-
stitution effects is to apply PCA on the raw features, and then perform the feature
importance analysis on the orthogonal features. See Belsley et al. [1980], Goldberger
[1991, pp. 245–253], and Hill et al. [2001] for further details.
8.3.1
Mean Decrease Impurity
Mean decrease impurity (MDI) is a fast, explanatory-importance (in-sample, IS)
method specific to tree-based classifiers, like RF. At each node of each decision
tree, the selected feature splits the subset it received in such a way that impurity is

## Page 142

FEATURE IMPORTANCE WITH SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS
115
decreased. Therefore, we can derive for each decision tree how much of the overall
impurity decrease can be assigned to each feature. And given that we have a forest of
trees, we can average those values across all estimators and rank the features accord-
ingly. See Louppe et al. [2013] for a detailed description. There are some important
considerations you must keep in mind when working with MDI:
1. Masking effects take place when some features are systematically ignored
by tree-based classifiers in favor of others. In order to avoid them, set
max_features=int(1)when using sklearn’s RF class. In this way, only one
random feature is considered per level.
(a) Every feature is given a chance (at some random levels of some random
trees) to reduce impurity.
(b) Make sure that features with zero importance are not averaged, since the
only reason for a 0 is that the feature was not randomly chosen. Replace
those values with np.nan.
2. The procedure is obviously IS. Every feature will have some importance, even
if they have no predictive power whatsoever.
3. MDI cannot be generalized to other non-tree based classifiers.
4. By construction, MDI has the nice property that feature importances add up to
1, and every feature importance is bounded between 0 and 1.
5. The method does not address substitution effects in the presence of correlated
features. MDI dilutes the importance of substitute features, because of their
interchangeability: The importance of two identical features will be halved, as
they are randomly chosen with equal probability.
6. Strobl et al. [2007] show experimentally that MDI is biased towards some pre-
dictor variables. White and Liu [1994] argue that, in case of single decision
trees, this bias is due to an unfair advantage given by popular impurity func-
tions toward predictors with a large number of categories.
Sklearn’s RandomForest class implements MDI as the default feature impor-
tance score. This choice is likely motivated by the ability to compute MDI on the
fly, with minimum computational cost.1 Snippet 8.2 illustrates an implementation of
MDI, incorporating the considerations listed earlier.

Mean Decrease Accuracy
Mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is a slow, predictive-importance (out-of-sample,
OOS) method. First, it fits a classifier; second, it derives its performance OOS accord-
ing to some performance score (accuracy, negative log-loss, etc.); third, it permutates
each column of the features matrix (X), one column at a time, deriving the perfor-
mance OOS after each column’s permutation. The importance of a feature is a func-
tion of the loss in performance caused by its column’s permutation. Some relevant
considerations include:
1. This method can be applied to any classifier, not only tree-based classifiers.
2. MDA is not limited to accuracy as the sole performance score. For example,
in the context of meta-labeling applications, we may prefer to score a classifier
with F1 rather than accuracy (see Chapter 14, Section 14.8 for an explanation).
That is one reason a better descriptive name would have been “permutation
importance.” When the scoring function does not correspond to a metric space,
MDA results should be used as a ranking.
3. Like MDI, the procedure is also susceptible to substitution effects in the pres-
ence of correlated features. Given two identical features, MDA always con-
siders one to be redundant to the other. Unfortunately, MDA will make both
features appear to be outright irrelevant, even if they are critical.
4. Unlike MDI, it is possible that MDA concludes that all features are unimpor-
tant. That is because MDA is based on OOS performance.
5. The CV must be purged and embargoed, for the reasons explained in Chapter 7.
Snippet 8.3 implements MDA feature importance with sample weights, with
purged k-fold CV, and with scoring by negative log-loss or accuracy. It measures
MDA importance as a function of the improvement (from permutating to not permu-
tating the feature), relative to the maximum possible score (negative log-loss of 0, or
accuracy of 1). Note that, in some cases, the improvement may be negative, meaning
that the feature is actually detrimental to the forecasting power of the ML algorithm.

FEATURE IMPORTANCE WITHOUT SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS
Substitution effects can lead us to discard important features that happen to be redun-
dant. This is not generally a problem in the context of prediction, but it could lead
us to wrong conclusions when we are trying to understand, improve, or simplify a
model. For this reason, the following single feature importance method can be a good
complement to MDI and MDA.
8.4.1
Single Feature Importance
Single feature importance (SFI) is a cross-section predictive-importance (out-of-
sample) method. It computes the OOS performance score of each feature in isolation.
A few considerations:
1. This method can be applied to any classifier, not only tree-based classifiers.
2. SFI is not limited to accuracy as the sole performance score.
3. Unlike MDI and MDA, no substitution effects take place, since only one feature
is taken into consideration at a time.
4. Like MDA, it can conclude that all features are unimportant, because perfor-
mance is evaluated via OOS CV.

## Page 145

118
FEATURE IMPORTANCE
The main limitation of SFI is that a classifier with two features can perform better
than the bagging of two single-feature classifiers. For example, (1) feature B may be
useful only in combination with feature A; or (2) feature B may be useful in explain-
ing the splits from feature A, even if feature B alone is inaccurate. In other words,
joint effects and hierarchical importance are lost in SFI. One alternative would be
to compute the OOS performance score from subsets of features, but that calcula-
tion will become intractable as more features are considered. Snippet 8.4 demon-
strates one possible implementation of the SFI method. A discussion of the function
cvScore can be found in Chapter 7.

scoring=scoring,cvGen=cvGen)
imp.loc[featName,'mean']=df0.mean()
imp.loc[featName,'std']=df0.std()*df0.shape[0]**-.5
return imp
8.4.2
Orthogonal Features
As argued in Section 8.3, substitution effects dilute the importance of features mea-
sured by MDI, and significantly underestimate the importance of features measured
by MDA. A partial solution is to orthogonalize the features before applying MDI and
MDA. An orthogonalization procedure such as principal components analysis (PCA)
does not prevent all substitution effects, but at least it should alleviate the impact of
linear substitution effects.
Consider a matrix {Xt,n} of stationary features, with observations t = 1, … , T and
variables n = 1, … , N. First, we compute the standardized features matrix Z, such
that Zt,n = 𝜎−1
n (Xt,n −𝜇n), where 𝜇n is the mean of {Xt,n}t=1,…,T and 𝜎n is the standard
deviation of {Xt,n}t=1,…,T. Second, we compute the eigenvalues Λ and eigenvectors
W such that Z′ZW = WΛ, where Λ is an NxN diagonal matrix with main entries
sorted in descending order, and W is an NxN orthonormal matrix. Third, we derive
the orthogonal features as P = ZW. We can verify the orthogonality of the features
by noting that P′P = W′Z′ZW = W′WΛW′W = Λ.
The diagonalization is done on Z rather than X, for two reasons: (1) centering the
data ensures that the first principal component is correctly oriented in the main direc-
tion of the observations. It is equivalent to adding an intercept in a linear regression;
(2) re-scaling the data makes PCA focus on explaining correlations rather than vari-
ances. Without re-scaling, the first principal components would be dominated by the

columns of X with highest variance, and we would not learn much about the structure
or relationship between the variables.
Snippet 8.5 computes the smallest number of orthogonal features that explain at
least 95% of the variance of Z.

Besides addressing substitution effects, working with orthogonal features provides
two additional benefits: (1) orthogonalization can also be used to reduce the dimen-
sionality of the features matrix X, by dropping features associated with small eigen-
values. This usually speeds up the convergence of ML algorithms; (2) the analysis is
conducted on features designed to explain the structure of the data.
Let me stress this latter point. An ubiquitous concern throughout the book is the
risk of overfitting. ML algorithms will always find a pattern, even if that pattern is
a statistical fluke. You should always be skeptical about the purportedly important
features identified by any method, including MDI, MDA, and SFI. Now, suppose
that you derive orthogonal features using PCA. Your PCA analysis has determined
that some features are more “principal” than others, without any knowledge of the
labels (unsupervised learning). That is, PCA has ranked features without any possible
overfitting in a classification sense. When your MDI, MDA, or SFI analysis selects
as most important (using label information) the same features that PCA chose as

## Page 147

FEATURE IMPORTANCE
FIGURE 8.1
Scatter plot of eigenvalues (x-axis) and MDI levels (y-axis) in log-log scale
principal (ignoring label information), this constitutes confirmatory evidence that the
pattern identified by the ML algorithm is not entirely overfit. If the features were
entirely random, the PCA ranking would have no correspondance with the feature
importance ranking. Figure 8.1 displays the scatter plot of eigenvalues associated with
an eigenvector (x-axis) paired with MDI of the feature associated with an engenvector
(y-axis). The Pearson correlation is 0.8491 (p-value below 1E-150), evidencing that
PCA identified informative features and ranked them correctly without overfitting.
I find it useful to compute the weighted Kendall’s tau between the feature impor-
tances and their associated eigenvalues (or equivalently, their inverse PCA rank). The
closer this value is to 1, the stronger is the consistency between PCA ranking and fea-
ture importance ranking. One argument for preferring a weighted Kendall’s tau over
the standard Kendall is that we want to prioritize rank concordance among the most
importance features. We do not care so much about rank concordance among irrele-
vant (likely noisy) features. The hyperbolic-weighted Kendall’s tau for the sample in
Figure 8.1 is 0.8206.
Snippet 8.6 shows how to compute this correlation using Scipy. In this exam-
ple, sorting the features in descending importance gives us a PCA rank sequence
very close to an ascending list. Because the weightedtau function gives higher
weight to higher values, we compute the correlation on the inverse PCA ranking,
pcRank**-1. The resulting weighted Kendall’s tau is relatively high, at 0.8133.

8.5
PARALLELIZED VS. STACKED FEATURE IMPORTANCE
There are at least two research approaches to feature importance. First, for each secu-
rity i in an investment universe i = 1, … , I, we form a dataset (Xi, yi), and derive the
feature importance in parallel. For example, let us denote 𝜆i,j,k the importance of
feature j on instrument i according to criterion k. Then we can aggregate all results
across the entire universe to derive a combined Λj,k importance of feature j accord-
ing to criterion k. Features that are important across a wide variety of instruments are
more likely to be associated with an underlying phenomenon, particularly when these
feature importances exhibit high rank correlation across the criteria. It may be worth
studying in-depth the theoretical mechanism that makes these features predictive. The
main advantage of this approach is that it is computationally fast, as it can be paral-
lelized. A disadvantage is that, due to substitution effects, important features may
swap their ranks across instruments, increasing the variance of the estimated 𝜆i,j,k.
This disadvantage becomes relatively minor if we average 𝜆i,j,k across instruments
for a sufficiently large investment universe.
A second alternative is what I call “features stacking.” It consists in stacking all
datasets {(̃Xi, yi)}i=1,…,I into a single combined dataset (X, y), wherẽ Xi is a trans-
formed instance of Xi (e.g., standardized on a rolling trailing window). The purpose
of this transformation is to ensure some distributional homogeneity,̃ Xi ∼X. Under
this approach, the classifier must learn what features are more important across all
instruments simultaneously, as if the entire investment universe were in fact a single
instrument. Features stacking presents some advantages: (1) The classifier will be fit
on a much larger dataset than the one used with the parallelized (first) approach; (2)
the importance is derived directly, and no weighting scheme is required for combining
the results; (3) conclusions are more general and less biased by outliers or overfitting;
and (4) because importance scores are not averaged across instruments, substitution
effects do not cause the dampening of those scores.
I usually prefer features stacking, not only for features importance but whenever a
classifier can be fit on a set of instruments, including for the purpose of model predic-
tion. That reduces the likelihood of overfitting an estimator to a particular instrument
or small dataset. The main disadvantage of stacking is that it may consume a lot of

memory and resources, however that is where a sound knowledge of HPC techniques
will come in handy (Chapters 20–22).
8.6
EXPERIMENTS WITH SYNTHETIC DATA
In this section, we are going to test how these feature importance methods respond
to synthetic data. We are going to generate a dataset (X, y) composed on three kinds
of features:
1. Informative: These are features that are used to determine the label.
2. Redundant: These are random linear combinations of the informative features.
They will cause substitution effects.
3. Noise: These are features that have no bearing on determining the observation’s
label.
Snippet 8.7 shows how we can generate a synthetic dataset of 40 features
where 10 are informative, 10 are redundant, and 20 are noise, on 10,000 obser-
vations. For details on how sklearn generates synthetic datasets, visit: http://scikit-

FIGURE 8.2
MDI feature importance computed on a synthetic dataset
Figure 8.2 shows results for MDI. For each feature, the horizontal bar indicates
the mean MDI value across all the decision trees, and the horizontal line is the stan-
dard deviation of that mean. Since MDI importances add up to 1, if all features were
equally important, each importance would have a value of 1/40. The vertical dotted
line marks that 1/40 threshold, separating features whose importance exceeds what
would be expected from undistinguishable features. As you can see, MDI does a very
good job in terms of placing all informative and redundant features above the red dot-
ted line, with the exception of R_5, which did not make the cut by a small margin.
Substitution effects cause some informative or redundant features to rank better than
others, which was expected.
Figure 8.3 shows that MDA also did a good job. Results are consistent with those
from MDI’s in the sense that all the informed and redundant features rank better than
the noise feature, with the exception of R_6, likely due to a substitution effect. One not
so positive aspect of MDA is that the standard deviation of the means are somewhat
higher, although that could be addressed by increasing the number of partitions in
the purged k-fold CV, from, say, 10 to 100 (at the cost of 10 × the computation time
without parallelization).
Figure 8.4 shows that SFI also does a decent job; however, a few important fea-
tures rank worse than noise (I_6, I_2, I_9, I_1, I_3, R_5), likely due to joint effects.

The labels are a function of a combination of features, and trying to forecast them
independently misses the joint effects. Still, SFI is useful as a complement to MDI
and MDA, precisely because both types of analyses are affected by different kinds of
problems.
EXERCISES

(a) Generate a dataset (X, y).
(b) Apply a PCA transformation on X, which we denotė X.
(c) Compute MDI, MDA, and SFI feature importance on (̇X, y), where the base
estimator is RF.
(d) Do the three methods agree on what features are important? Why?
8.2 From exercise 1, generate a new dataset (̈X, y), wherë X is a feature union of X
anḋ X.
(a) Compute MDI, MDA, and SFI feature importance on (̈X, y), where the base

CHAPTER 9
Hyper-Parameter Tuning with
Cross-Validation
9.1
MOTIVATION
Hyper-parameter tuning is an essential step in fitting an ML algorithm. When this
is not done properly, the algorithm is likely to overfit, and live performance will
disappoint. The ML literature places special attention on cross-validating any tuned
hyper-parameter. As we have seen in Chapter 7, cross-validation (CV) in finance is
an especially difficult problem, where solutions from other fields are likely to fail. In
this chapter we will discuss how to tune hyper-parameters using the purged k-fold
CV method. The references section lists studies that propose alternative methods that
may be useful in specific problems.
9.2
GRID SEARCH CROSS-VALIDATION
Grid search cross-validation conducts an exhaustive search for the combination of
parameters that maximizes the CV performance, according to some user-defined
score function. When we do not know much about the underlying structure of the
data, this is a reasonable first approach. Scikit-learn has implemented this logic in
the function GridSearchCV, which accepts a CV generator as an argument. For
the reasons explained in Chapter 7, we need to pass our PurgedKFold class (Snip-
pet 7.3) in order to prevent that GridSearchCV overfits the ML estimator to leaked
information.

clfHyperFit,
which
implements
a
purged
GridSearchCV. The argument ﬁt_params can be used to pass sample_weight,
and param_grid contains the values that will be combined into a grid. In addition,
this function allows for the bagging of the tuned estimator. Bagging an estimator is
generally a good idea for the reasons explained in Chapter 6, and the above function
incorporates logic to that purpose.
I advise you to use scoring='f1' in the context of meta-labeling applications,
for the following reason. Suppose a sample with a very large number of negative (i.e.,
label ‘0’) cases. A classifier that predicts all cases to be negative will achieve high
'accuracy' or 'neg_log_loss', even though it has not learned from the features
how to discriminate between cases. In fact, such a model achieves zero recall and
undefined precision (see Chapter 3, Section 3.7). The 'f1' score corrects for that
performance inflation by scoring the classifier in terms of precision and recall (see
Chapter 14, Section 14.8).
For other (non-meta-labeling) applications, it is fine to use 'accuracy' or
'neg_log_loss', because we are equally interested in predicting all cases. Note
that a relabeling of cases has no impact on 'accuracy' or 'neg_log_loss', how-
ever it will have an impact on 'f1'.
This example introduces nicely one limitation of sklearn’s Pipelines : Their
fit method does not expect a sample_weight argument. Instead, it expects a
ﬁt_params keyworded argument. That is a bug that has been reported in GitHub;
however, it may take some time to fix it, as it involves rewriting and testing much
functionality. Until then, feel free to use the workaround in Snippet 9.2. It creates a

new class, called MyPipeline, which inherits all methods from sklearn’s Pipeline.
It overwrites the inherited ﬁt method with a new one that handles the argument
sample_weight, after which it redirects to the parent class.

9.3
RANDOMIZED SEARCH CROSS-VALIDATION
For ML algorithms with a large number of parameters, a grid search cross-validation
(CV) becomes computationally intractable. In this case, an alternative with good sta-
tistical properties is to sample each parameter from a distribution (Begstra et al. [2011,
2012]). This has two benefits: First, we can control for the number of combinations
we will search for, regardless of the dimensionality of the problem (the equivalent
to a computational budget). Second, having parameters that are relatively irrelevant
performance-wise will not substantially increase our search time, as would be the
case with grid search CV.
Rather than writing a new function to work with RandomizedSearchCV, let us
expand Snippet 9.1 to incorporate an option to this purpose. A possible implementa-
tion is Snippet 9.3.

9.3.1
Log-Uniform Distribution
It is common for some ML algorithms to accept non-negative hyper-parameters only.
That is the case of some very popular parameters, such as C in the SVC classifier
and gamma in the RBF kernel.1 We could draw random numbers from a uniform
distribution bounded between 0 and some large value, say 100. That would mean that
99% of the values would be expected to be greater than 1. That is not necessarily the
most effective way of exploring the feasibility region of parameters whose functions
do not respond linearly. For example, an SVC can be as responsive to an increase in C
from 0.01 to 1 as to an increase in C from 1 to 100.2 So sampling C from a U [0, 100]
(uniform) distribution will be inefficient. In those instances, it seems more effective to
draw values from a distribution where the logarithm of those draws will be distributed
uniformly. I call that a “log-uniform distribution,” and since I could not find it in the
literature, I must define it properly.
A random variable x follows a log-uniform distribution between a > 0 and b > a
if and only if log [x] ∼U [log [a] , log [b]
]. This distribution has a CDF:
F [x] =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
log [x] −log [a]
log [b] −log [a]
for a ≤x ≤b
0
for x < a
1
for x > b
From this, we derive a PDF:
f [x] =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
1
x log [b∕a]
for a ≤x ≤b
0
for x < a
0
for x > b
Note that the CDF is invariant to the base of the logarithm, since
log
[ x
a
]
log
[ b
a
] =
logc
[ x
a
]
logc
[ b

for any base c, thus the random variable is not a function of c. Snippet 9.4 implements

HYPER-PARAMETER TUNING WITH CROSS-VALIDATION
9.4
SCORING AND HYPER-PARAMETER TUNING
Snippets 9.1 and 9.3 set scoring='f1' for meta-labeling applications. For
other applications, they set scoring='neg_log_loss' rather than the standard
scoring='accuracy'. Although accuracy has a more intuitive interpretation, I
suggest that you use neg_log_loss when you are tuning hyper-parameters for an
investment strategy. Let me explain my reasoning.
Suppose that your ML investment strategy predicts that you should buy a secu-
rity, with high probability. You will enter a large long position, as a function of the
strategy’s confidence. If the prediction was erroneous, and the market sells off instead,
you will lose a lot of money. And yet, accuracy accounts equally for an erroneous buy
prediction with high probability and for an erroneous buy prediction with low proba-
bility. Moreover, accuracy can offset a miss with high probability with a hit with low
probability.
Investment strategies profit from predicting the right label with high confidence.
Gains from good predictions with low confidence will not suffice to offset the losses
from bad predictions with high confidence. For this reason, accuracy does not provide
a realistic scoring of the classifier’s performance. Conversely, log loss3 (aka cross-
entropy loss) computes the log-likelihood of the classifier given the true label, which
takes predictions’ probabilities into account. Log loss can be estimated as follows:
L [Y, P] = −log [Prob [Y |P]] = −N−1
N−1
∑
n=0
K−1
∑
k=0
yn,klog [pn,k
]
where
r pn,k is the probability associated with prediction n of label k.
r Y is a 1-of-K binary indicator matrix, such that yn,k = 1 when observation n was
assigned label k out of K possible labels, and 0 otherwise.
Suppose that a classifier predicts two 1s, where the true labels are 1 and 0. The first
prediction is a hit and the second prediction is a miss, thus accuracy is 50%. Figure 9.2
plots the cross-entropy loss when these predictions come from probabilities ranging
[0.5, 0.9]. One can observe that on the right side of the figure, log loss is large due to
misses with high probability, even though the accuracy is 50% in all cases.
There is a second reason to prefer cross-entropy loss over accuracy. CV scores a
classifier by applying sample weights (see Chapter 7, Section 7.5). As you may recall
from Chapter 4, observation weights were determined as a function of the observa-
tion’s absolute return. The implication is that sample weighted cross-entropy loss
estimates the classifier’s performance in terms of variables involved in a PnL (mark-
to-market profit and losses) calculation: It uses the correct label for the side, probabil-
ity for the position size, and sample weight for the observation’s return/outcome. That

FIGURE 9.2
Log loss as a function of predicted probabilities of hit and miss
is the right ML performance metric for hyper-parameter tuning of financial applica-
tions, not accuracy.
When we use log loss as a scoring statistic, we often prefer to change its sign,
hence referring to “neg log loss.” The reason for this change is cosmetic, driven by
intuition: A high neg log loss value is preferred to a low neg log loss value, just
as with accuracy. Keep in mind this sklearn bug when you use neg_log_loss:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9144. To circumvent this bug, you
should use the cvScore function presented in Chapter 7.

CHAPTER 10
Bet Sizing
10.1
MOTIVATION
There are fascinating parallels between strategy games and investing. Some of the
best portfolio managers I have worked with are excellent poker players, perhaps more
so than chess players. One reason is bet sizing, for which Texas Hold’em provides a
great analogue and training ground. Your ML algorithm can achieve high accuracy,
but if you do not size your bets properly, your investment strategy will inevitably
lose money. In this chapter we will review a few approaches to size bets from ML
predictions.
10.2
STRATEGY-INDEPENDENT BET SIZING APPROACHES
Consider two strategies on the same instrument. Let mi,t ∈[−1, 1] be the bet size of
strategy i at time t, where mi,t = −1 indicates a full short position and mi,t = 1 indi-
cates a full long position. Suppose that one strategy produced a sequence of bet sizes
[m1,1, m1,2, m1,3] = [.5, 1, 0], as the market price followed a sequence [p1, p2, p3] =
[1, .5, 1.25], where pt is the price at time t. The other strategy produced a sequence
[m2,1, m2,2, m2,3] = [1, .5, 0], as it was forced to reduce its bet size once the market
moved against the initial full position. Both strategies produced forecasts that turned
out to be correct (the price increased by 25% between p1 and p3), however the first
strategy made money (0.5) while the second strategy lost money (−.125).
We would prefer to size positions in such way that we reserve some cash for the
possibility that the trading signal strengthens before it weakens. One option is to
compute the series ct = ct,l −ct,s, where ct,l is the number of concurrent long bets at
time t, and ct,s is the number of concurrent short bets at time t. This bet concurrency is
derived, for each side, similarly to how we computed label concurrency in Chapter 4
(recall the t1 object, with overlapping time spans). We fit a mixture of two Gaussians
141

on {ct}, applying a method like the one described in L´opez de Prado and Foreman
[2014]. Then, the bet size is derived as
mt =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
F[ct] −F[0]
1 −F[0]
if ct ≥0
F[ct] −F[0]
F[0]
if ct < 0
where F[x] is the CDF of the fitted mixture of two Gaussians for a value x. For exam-
ple, we could size the bet as 0.9 when the probability of observing a signal of greater
value is only 0.1. The stronger the signal, the smaller the probability that the signal
becomes even stronger, hence the greater the bet size.
A second solution is to follow a budgeting approach. We compute the maximum
number (or some other quantile) of concurrent long bets, maxi{ci,l}, and the max-
imum number of concurrent short bets, maxi{ci,s}. Then we derive the bet size as
mt = ct,l
1
maxi{ci,l} −ct,s
1
maxi{ci,s}, where ct,l is the number of concurrent long bets at
time t, and ct,s is the number of concurrent short bets at time t. The goal is that the
maximum position is not reached before the last concurrent signal is triggered.
A third approach is to apply meta-labeling, as we explained in Chapter 3. We fit a
classifier, such as an SVC or RF, to determine the probability of misclassification, and
use that probability to derive the bet size. 1 This approach has a couple of advantages:
First, the ML algorithm that decides the bet sizes is independent of the primary model,
allowing for the incorporation of features predictive of false positives (see Chap-
ter 3). Second, the predicted probability can be directly translated into bet size. Let us
see how.
10.3
BET SIZING FROM PREDICTED PROBABILITIES
Let us denote p [x] the probability that label x takes place. For two possible outcomes,
x ∈{−1, 1}, we would like to test the null hypothesis H0 : p [x = 1] = 1
2. We compute
the test statistic z =
p[x=1]−1
2
√
p[x=1](1−p[x=1]) =
2p[x=1]−1
2
√
p[x=1](1−p[x=1]) ∼Z, with z ∈(−∞, +∞)
and where Z represents the standard Normal distribution. We derive the bet size as
m = 2Z [z] −1, where m ∈[−1, 1] and Z [.] is the CDF of Z.
For more than two possible outcomes, we follow a one-versus-rest method. Let
X = {−1, … , 0, … , 1} be various labels associated with bet sizes, and x ∈X the pre-
dicted label. In other words, the label is identified by the bet size associated with it. For
each label i = 1, … , ‖X‖, we estimate a probability pi, with ∑‖X‖
i=1 pi = 1. We define
1 The references section lists a number of articles that explain how these probabilities are derived. Usu-
ally these probabilities incorporate information about the goodness of the fit, or confidence in the
prediction. See Wu et al. [2004], and visit http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#scores-and-
probabilities.

Figure 10.1 plots the bet size as a function of test statistic. Snippet 10.1 implements
the translation from probabilities to bet size. It handles the possibility that the predic-
tion comes from a meta-labeling estimator, as well from a standard labeling estimator.
In step #2, it also averages active bets, and discretizes the final value, which we will
explain in the following sections.

override an old bet as a new bet arrives; however, that is likely to lead to excessive
turnover. A more sensible approach is to average all sizes across all bets still active at a
given point in time. Snippet 10.2 illustrates one possible implementation of this idea.

Averaging reduces some of the excess turnover, but still it is likely that small trades
will be triggered with every prediction. As this jitter would cause unnecessary

DYNAMIC BET SIZES AND LIMIT PRICES
Recall the triple-barrier labeling method presented in Chapter 3. Bar i is formed
at time ti,0, at which point we forecast the first barrier that will be touched. That
prediction implies a forecasted price, Eti,0[pti,1], consistent with the barriers’ settings.
In the period elapsed until the outcome takes place, t ∈[ti,0, ti,1], the price pt fluctuates
and additional forecasts may be formed, Etj,0[pti,1], where j ∈[i + 1, I] and tj,0 ≤ti,1.
In Sections 10.4 and 10.5 we discussed methods for averaging the active bets and

discretizing the bet size as new forecasts are formed. In this section we will introduce
an approach to adjust bet sizes as market price pt and forecast price fi fluctuate. In the
process, we will derive the order’s limit price.
Let qt be the current position, Q the maximum absolute position size, and̂ qi,t the
target position size associated with forecast fi, such that̂
qi,t = int[m[𝜔, fi −pt]Q]
m [𝜔, x] =
x
√
𝜔+ x2
where m [𝜔, x] is the bet size, x = fi −pt is the divergence between the current market
price and the forecast, 𝜔is a coefficient that regulates the width of the sigmoid func-
tion, and Int [x] is the integer value of x. Note that for a real-valued price divergence
x, −1 < m [𝜔, x] < 1, the integer valuê qi,t is bounded −Q <̂ qi,t < Q.
The target position sizê qi,t can be dynamically adjusted as pt changes. In particu-
lar, as pt →fi we get̂ qi,t →0, because the algorithm wants to realize the gains. This
implies a breakeven limit pricē p for the order sizê qi,t −qt, to avoid realizing losses.
In particular,̄
p =
1
|̂qi,t −qt|
|̂qi,t|
∑
j=|qt+sgn[̂qi,t−qt]|
L
[
fi, 𝜔, j
Q
]
where L[fi, 𝜔, m] is the inverse function of m[𝜔, fi −pt] with respect to pt,
L[fi, 𝜔, m] = fi −m
√
𝜔
1 −m2
We do not need to worry about the case m2 = 1, because |̂qi,t| < 1. Since this
function is monotonic, the algorithm cannot realize losses as pt →fi.
Let us calibrate 𝜔. Given a user-defined pair (x, m∗), such that x = fi −pt and m∗=
m [𝜔, x], the inverse function of m [𝜔, x] with respect to 𝜔is
𝜔= x2(m∗−2 −1)
Snippet 10.4 implements the algorithm that computes the dynamic position size
and limit prices as a function of pt and fi. First, we calibrate the sigmoid function,
so that it returns a bet size of m∗= .95 for a price divergence of x = 10. Second,
we compute the target position̂ qi,t for a maximum position Q = 100, fi = 115 and
pt = 100. If you try fi = 110, you will get̂ qi,t = 95, consistent with the calibration
of 𝜔. Third, the limit price for this order of sizê qi,t −qt = 97 is pt < 112.3657 < fi,
which is between the current price and the forecasted price.

As an alternative to the sigmoid function, we could have used a power functioñ
m [𝜔, x] = sgn [x] |x|𝜔, where 𝜔≥0, x ∈[−1, 1], which results iñ m [𝜔, x] ∈[−1, 1].
This alternative presents the advantages that:
r̃ m [𝜔, −1] = −1,̃ m [𝜔, 1] = 1.
r Curvature can be directly manipulated through 𝜔.
r For 𝜔> 1, the function goes from concave to convex, rather than the other way
around, hence the function is almost flat around the inflexion point.
We leave the derivation of the equations for a power function as an exercise. Figure
10.3 plots the bet sizes (y-axis) as a function of price divergence f −pt (x-axis) for
both the sigmoid and power functions.

CHAPTER 11
The Dangers of Backtesting
11.1
MOTIVATION
Backtesting is one of the most essential, and yet least understood, techniques in the
quant arsenal. A common misunderstanding is to think of backtesting as a research
tool. Researching and backtesting is like drinking and driving. Do not research under
the influence of a backtest. Most backtests published in journals are flawed, as the
result of selection bias on multiple tests (Bailey, Borwein, L´opez de Prado, and Zhu
[2014]; Harvey et al. [2016]). A full book could be written listing all the different
errors people make while backtesting. I may be the academic author with the largest
number of journal articles on backtesting1 and investment performance metrics, and
still I do not feel I would have the stamina to compile all the different errors I have
seen over the past 20 years. This chapter is not a crash course on backtesting, but a
short list of some of the common errors that even seasoned professionals make.
11.2
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: THE FLAWLESS BACKTEST
In its narrowest definition, a backtest is a historical simulation of how a strategy would
have performed should it have been run over a past period of time. As such, it is a
hypothetical, and by no means an experiment. At a physics laboratory, like Berkeley
Lab, we can repeat an experiment while controlling for environmental variables, in
order to deduce a precise cause-effect relationship. In contrast, a backtest is not an
experiment, and it does not prove anything. A backtest guarantees nothing, not even
achieving that Sharpe ratio if we could travel back in time in our retrofitted DeLorean
DMC-12 (Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012]). Random draws would have been dif-
ferent. The past would not repeat itself.

THE DANGERS OF BACKTESTING
What is the point of a backtest then? It is a sanity check on a number of variables,
including bet sizing, turnover, resilience to costs, and behavior under a given scenario.
A good backtest can be extremely helpful, but backtesting well is extremely hard. In
2014 a team of quants at Deutsche Bank, led by Yin Luo, published a study under the
title “Seven Sins of Quantitative Investing” (Luo et al. [2014]). It is a very graphic
and accessible piece that I would advise everyone in this business to read carefully.
In it, this team mentions the usual suspects:
1. Survivorship bias: Using as investment universe the current one, hence ignor-
ing that some companies went bankrupt and securities were delisted along the
way.
2. Look-ahead bias: Using information that was not public at the moment the
simulated decision would have been made. Be certain about the timestamp for
each data point. Take into account release dates, distribution delays, and backfill
corrections.
3. Storytelling: Making up a story ex-post to justify some random pattern.
4. Data mining and data snooping: Training the model on the testing
set.
5. Transaction costs: Simulating transaction costs is hard because the only way
to be certain about that cost would have been to interact with the trading book
(i.e., to do the actual trade).
6. Outliers: Basing a strategy on a few extreme outcomes that may never happen
again as observed in the past.
7. Shorting: Taking a short position on cash products requires finding a lender.
The cost of lending and the amount available is generally unknown, and
depends on relations, inventory, relative demand, etc.
These are just a few basic errors that most papers published in journals make rou-
tinely. Other common errors include computing performance using a non-standard
method (Chapter 14); ignoring hidden risks; focusing only on returns while ignor-
ing other metrics; confusing correlation with causation; selecting an unrepresentative
time period; failing to expect the unexpected; ignoring the existence of stop-out lim-
its or margin calls; ignoring funding costs; and forgetting practical aspects (Sarfati
[2015]). There are many more, but really, there is no point in listing them, because of
the title of the next section.
11.3
EVEN IF YOUR BACKTEST IS FLAWLESS, IT IS
PROBABLY WRONG
Congratulations! Your backtest is flawless in the sense that everyone can reproduce
your results, and your assumptions are so conservative that not even your boss could
object to them. You have paid for every trade more than double what anyone could
possibly ask. You have executed hours after the information was known by half the
globe, at a ridiculously low volume participation rate. Despite all these egregious

## Page 180

A FEW GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
153
costs, your backtest still makes a lot of money. Yet, this flawless backtest is probably
wrong. Why? Because only an expert can produce a flawless backtest. Becoming
an expert means that you have run tens of thousands of backtests over the years. In
conclusion, this is not the first backtest you produce, so we need to account for the
possibility that this is a false discovery, a statistical fluke that inevitably comes up
after you run multiple tests on the same dataset.
The maddening thing about backtesting is that, the better you become at it, the
more likely false discoveries will pop up. Beginners fall for the seven sins of Luo et al.
[2014] (there are more, but who’s counting?). Professionals may produce flawless
backtests, and will still fall for multiple testing, selection bias, or backtest overfitting
(Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2014b]).
11.4
BACKTESTING IS NOT A RESEARCH TOOL
Chapter 8 discussed substitution effects, joint effects, masking, MDI, MDA, SFI,
parallelized features, stacked features, etc. Even if some features are very important,
it does not mean that they can be monetized through an investment strategy. Con-
versely, there are plenty of strategies that will appear to be profitable even though they
are based on irrelevant features. Feature importance is a true research tool, because it
helps us understand the nature of the patterns uncovered by the ML algorithm, regard-
less of their monetization. Critically, feature importance is derived ex-ante, before the
historical performance is simulated.
In contrast, a backtest is not a research tool. It provides us with very little insight
into the reason why a particular strategy would have made money. Just as a lottery
winner may feel he has done something to deserve his luck, there is always some
ex-post story (Luo’s sin number three). Authors claim to have found hundreds of
“alphas” and “factors,” and there is always some convoluted explanation for them.
Instead, what they have found are the lottery tickets that won the last game. The
winner has cashed out, and those numbers are useless for the next round. If you would
not pay extra for those lottery tickets, why would you care about those hundreds of
alphas? Those authors never tell us about all the tickets that were sold, that is, the
millions of simulations it took to find these “lucky” alphas.
The purpose of a backtest is to discard bad models, not to improve them. Adjust-
ing your model based on the backtest results is a waste of time . . . and it’s danger-
ous. Invest your time and effort in getting all the components right, as we’ve dis-
cussed elsewhere in the book: structured data, labeling, weighting, ensembles, cross-
validation, feature importance, bet sizing, etc. By the time you are backtesting, it
is too late. Never backtest until your model has been fully specified. If the backtest
fails, start all over. If you do that, the chances of finding a false discovery will drop
substantially, but still they will not be zero.
11.5
A FEW GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Backtest overfitting can be defined as selection bias on multiple backtests. Backtest
overfitting takes place when a strategy is developed to perform well on a backtest, by

## Page 181

154
THE DANGERS OF BACKTESTING
monetizing random historical patterns. Because those random patterns are unlikely to
occur again in the future, the strategy so developed will fail. Every backtested strategy
is overfit to some extent as a result of “selection bias”: The only backtests that most
people share are those that portray supposedly winning investment strategies.
How to address backtest overfitting is arguably the most fundamental question
in quantitative finance. Why? Because if there was an easy answer to this question,
investment firms would achieve high performance with certainty, as they would invest
only in winning backtests. Journals would assess with confidence whether a strategy
may be a false positive. Finance could become a true science in the Popperian and
Lakatosian sense (L´opez de Prado [2017]). What makes backtest overfitting so hard to
assess is that the probability of false positives changes with every new test conducted
on the same dataset, and that information is either unknown by the researcher or not
shared with investors or referees. While there is no easy way to prevent overfitting, a
number of steps can help reduce its presence.
1. Develop models for entire asset classes or investment universes, rather than
for specific securities (Chapter 8). Investors diversify, hence they do not make
mistake X only on security Y. If you find mistake X only on security Y, no matter
how apparently profitable, it is likely a false discovery.
2. Apply bagging (Chapter 6) as a means to both prevent overfitting and reduce
the variance of the forecasting error. If bagging deteriorates the performance of
a strategy, it was likely overfit to a small number of observations or outliers.
3. Do not backtest until all your research is complete (Chapters 1–10).
4. Record every backtest conducted on a dataset so that the probability of backtest
overfitting may be estimated on the final selected result (see Bailey, Borwein,
L´opez de Prado, and Zhu [2017a] and Chapter 14), and the Sharpe ratio may
be properly deflated by the number of trials carried out (Bailey and L´opez de
Prado [2014b]).
5. Simulate scenarios rather than history (Chapter 12). A standard backtest is a
historical simulation, which can be easily overfit. History is just the random
path that was realized, and it could have been entirely different. Your strategy
should be profitable under a wide range of scenarios, not just the anecdotal
historical path. It is harder to overfit the outcome of thousands of “what if”
scenarios.
6. If the backtest fails to identify a profitable strategy, start from scratch. Resist
the temptation of reusing those results. Follow the Second Law of Backtesting.

STRATEGY SELECTION
In Chapter 7 we discussed how the presence of serial conditionality in labels defeats
standard k-fold cross-validation, because the random sampling will spatter redundant
observations into both the training and testing sets. We must find a different (true
out-of-sample) validation procedure: a procedure that evaluates our model on the
observations least likely to be correlated/redundant to those used to train the model.
See Arlot and Celisse [2010] for a survey.
Scikit-learn has implemented a walk-forward timefolds method.2 Under this
approach, testing moves forward (in the time direction) with the goal of preventing
leakage. This is consistent with the way historical backtests (and trading) are done.
However, in the presence of long-range serial dependence, testing one observation
away from the end of the training set may not suffice to avoid informational leakage.
We will retake this point in Chapter 12, Section 12.2.
One disadvantage of the walk-forward method is that it can be easily overfit. The
reason is that without random sampling, there is a single path of testing that can
be repeated over and over until a false positive appears. Like in standard CV, some
randomization is needed to avoid this sort of performance targeting or backtest opti-
mization, while avoiding the leakage of examples correlated to the training set into
the testing set. Next, we will introduce a CV method for strategy selection, based on
the estimation of the probability of backtest overfitting (PBO). We leave for Chapter
12 an explanation of CV methods for backtesting.
Bailey et al. [2017a] estimate the PBO through the combinatorially symmetric
cross-validation (CSCV) method. Schematically, this procedure works as follows.
First, we form a matrix M by collecting the performance series from the N trials.
In particular, each column n = 1, … , N represents a vector of PnL (mark-to-market
profits and losses) over t = 1, … , T observations associated with a particular model
configuration tried by the researcher. M is therefore a real-valued matrix of order
(TxN). The only conditions we impose are that (1) M is a true matrix, that is, with the
same number of rows for each column, where observations are synchronous for every
row across the N trials, and (2) the performance evaluation metric used to choose the
“optimal” strategy can be estimated on subsamples of each column. For example, if
that metric is the Sharpe ratio, we assume that the IID Normal distribution assumption
can be held on various slices of the reported performance. If different model configu-
rations trade with different frequencies, observations are aggregated (downsampled)
to match a common index t = 1, … , T.
Second, we partition M across rows, into an even number S of disjoint submatrices
of equal dimensions. Each of these submatrices Ms, with s = 1, … , S, is of order
( T
S xN).
Third, we form all combinations CS of Ms, taken in groups of size S
2. This gives a
total number of combinations
( S

( S −1

## Page 183

156
THE DANGERS OF BACKTESTING
For instance, if S = 16, we will form 12,780 combinations. Each combination c ∈CS
is composed of S∕2 submatrices Ms.
Fourth, for each combination c ∈CS, we:
1. Form the training set J, by joining the S∕2 submatrices Ms that constitute c. J is
a matrix of order ( T
S
S
2xN) = ( T
2 xN).
2. Form the testing set̄ J, as the complement of J in M. In other words,̄ J is the
( T
2 xN) matrix formed by all rows of M that are not part of J.
3. Form a vector R of performance statistics of order N, where the n-th item of R
reports the performance associated with the n-th column of J (the training set).
4. Determine the element n∗such that Rn ≤Rn∗, ∀n = 1, … , N. In other words,
n∗= arg maxn{Rn}.
5. Form a vector̄ R of performance statistics of order N, where the n-th item of̄
R reports the performance associated with the n-th column of̄ J (the testing
set).
6. Determine the relative rank of Rn∗within̄ R. We denote this relative rank as̄ 𝜔c,
wherē 𝜔c ∈(0, 1). This is the relative rank of the out-of-sample (OOS) per-
formance associated with the trial chosen in-sample (IS). If the strategy opti-
mization procedure does not overfit, we should observe that Rn∗systematically
outperforms̄ R (OOS), just as Rn∗outperformed R (IS).
7. Define the logit 𝜆c = log[̄ 𝜔c
1−̄𝜔c
]. This presents the property that 𝜆c = 0 when
Rn∗coincides with the median of̄ R. High logit values imply a consistency
between IS and OOS performance, which indicates a low level of backtest
overfitting.
Fifth, compute the distribution of ranks OOS by collecting all the 𝜆c, for c ∈CS.
The probability distribution function f(𝜆) is then estimated as the relative frequency
at which 𝜆occurred across all CS, with ∫∞
−∞f(𝜆)d𝜆= 1. Finally, the PBO is estimated
as PBO = ∫0
−∞f(𝜆)d𝜆, as that is the probability associated with IS optimal strategies
that underperform OOS.
The x-axis of Figure 11.1 shows the Sharpe ratio IS from the best strategy selected.
The y-axis shows the Sharpe ratio OOS for that same best strategy selected. As it can
be appreciated, there is a strong and persistent performance decay, caused by backtest
overfitting. Applying the above algorithm, we can derive the PBO associated with this
strategy selection process, as displayed in Figure 11.2.
The observations in each subset preserve the original time sequence. The random
sampling is done on the relatively uncorrelated subsets, rather than on the observa-
tions. See Bailey et al. [2017a] for an experimental analysis of the accuracy of this
methodology.

CHAPTER 12
Backtesting through Cross-Validation
12.1
MOTIVATION
A backtest evaluates out-of-sample the performance of an investment strategy using
past observations. These past observations can be used in two ways: (1) in a narrow
sense, to simulate the historical performance of an investment strategy, as if it had
been run in the past; and (2) in a broader sense, to simulate scenarios that did not
happen in the past. The first (narrow) approach, also known as walk-forward, is so
prevalent that, in fact, the term “backtest” has become a de facto synonym for “histor-
ical simulation.” The second (broader) approach is far less known, and in this chapter
we will introduce some novel ways to carry it out. Each approach has its pros and
cons, and each should be given careful consideration.
12.2
THE WALK-FORWARD METHOD
The most common backtest method in the literature is the walk-forward (WF)
approach. WF is a historical simulation of how the strategy would have performed in
past. Each strategy decision is based on observations that predate that decision. As
we saw in Chapter 11, carrying out a flawless WF simulation is a daunting task that
requires extreme knowledge of the data sources, market microstructure, risk manage-
ment, performance measurement standards (e.g., GIPS), multiple testing methods,
experimental mathematics, etc. Unfortunately, there is no generic recipe to conduct
a backtest. To be accurate and representative, each backtest must be customized to
evaluate the assumptions of a particular strategy.
WF enjoys two key advantages: (1) WF has a clear historical interpretation. Its
performance can be reconciled with paper trading. (2) History is a filtration; hence,
using trailing data guarantees that the testing set is out-of-sample (no leakage), as
long as purging has been properly implemented (see Chapter 7, Section 7.4.1). It is a
161

## Page 189

162
BACKTESTING THROUGH CROSS-VALIDATION
common mistake to find leakage in WF backtests, where t1.index falls within the
training set, but t1.values fall within the testing set (see Chapter 3). Embargoing is
not needed in WF backtests, because the training set always predates the testing set.
12.2.1
Pitfalls of the Walk-Forward Method
WF suffers from three major disadvantages: First, a single scenario is tested (the his-
torical path), which can be easily overfit (Bailey et al. [2014]). Second, WF is not
necessarily representative of future performance, as results can be biased by the par-
ticular sequence of datapoints. Proponents of the WF method typically argue that
predicting the past would lead to overly optimistic performance estimates. And yet,
very often fitting an outperforming model on the reversed sequence of observations
will lead to an underperforming WF backtest. The truth is, it is as easy to overfit a
walk-forward backtest as to overfit a walk-backward backtest, and the fact that chang-
ing the sequence of observations yields inconsistent outcomes is evidence of that
overfitting. If proponents of WF were right, we should observe that walk-backwards
backtests systematically outperform their walk-forward counterparts. That is not the
case, hence the main argument in favor of WF is rather weak.
To make this second disadvantage clearer, suppose an equity strategy that is back-
tested with a WF on S&P 500 data, starting January 1, 2007. Until March 15, 2009,
the mix of rallies and sell-offs will train the strategy to be market neutral, with low
confidence on every position. After that, the long rally will dominate the dataset, and
by January 1, 2017, buy forecasts will prevail over sell forecasts. The performance
would be very different had we played the information backwards, from January 1,
2017 to January 1, 2007 (a long rally followed by a sharp sell-off). By exploiting a
particular sequence, a strategy selected by WF may set us up for a debacle.
The third disadvantage of WF is that the initial decisions are made on a smaller
portion of the total sample. Even if a warm-up period is set, most of the information
is used by only a small portion of the decisions. Consider a strategy with a warm-up
period that uses t0 observations out of T. This strategy makes half of its decisions
( T−t0
2
)
on an average number of datapoints,
(T −t0
2
)−1 (
t0 + T + t0
2
) T −t0
4
= 1
4T + 3
4t0
which is only a 3
4
t0
T + 1
4 fraction of the observations. Although this problem is atten-
uated by increasing the warm-up period, doing so also reduces the length of the
backtest.
12.3
THE CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD
Investors often ask how a strategy would perform if subjected to a stress scenario
as unforeseeable as the 2008 crisis, or the dot-com bubble, or the taper tantrum, or

## Page 190

THE COMBINATORIAL PURGED CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD
163
the China scare of 2015–2016, etc. One way to answer is to split the observations
into two sets, one with the period we wish to test (testing set), and one with the
rest (training set). For example, a classifier would be trained on the period January
1, 2009–January 1, 2017, then tested on the period January 1, 2008–December 31,
2008. The performance we will obtain for 2008 is not historically accurate, since
the classifier was trained on data that was only available after 2008. But historical
accuracy was not the goal of the test. The objective of the test was to subject a strategy
ignorant of 2008 to a stress scenario such as 2008.
The goal of backtesting through cross-validation (CV) is not to derive histori-
cally accurate performance, but to infer future performance from a number of out-
of-sample scenarios. For each period of the backtest, we simulate the performance of
a classifier that knew everything except for that period.
Advantages
1. The test is not the result of a particular (historical) scenario. In fact, CV
tests k alternative scenarios, of which only one corresponds with the histori-
cal sequence.
2. Every decision is made on sets of equal size. This makes outcomes compara-
ble across periods, in terms of the amount of information used to make those
decisions.
3. Every observation is part of one and only one testing set. There is no warm-up
subset, thereby achieving the longest possible out-of-sample simulation.
Disadvantages
1. Like WF, a single backtest path is simulated (although not the historical one).
There is one and only one forecast generated per observation.
2. CV has no clear historical interpretation. The output does not simulate how the
strategy would have performed in the past, but how it may perform in the future
under various stress scenarios (a useful result in its own right).
3. Because the training set does not trail the testing set, leakage is possible.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid leaking testing information into the train-
ing set. See Chapter 7 for a discussion on how purging and embargoing can
help prevent informational leakage in the context of CV.
12.4
THE COMBINATORIAL PURGED CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD
In this section I will present a new method, which addresses the main drawback of the
WF and CV methods, namely that those schemes test a single path. I call it the “com-
binatorial purged cross-validation” (CPCV) method. Given a number 𝜑of backtest
paths targeted by the researcher, CPCV generates the precise number of combina-
tions of training/testing sets needed to generate those paths, while purging training
observations that contain leaked information.

12.4.1
Combinatorial Splits
Consider T observations partitioned into N groups without shuffling, where groups
n = 1, … , N −1 are of size ⌊T∕N⌋, the Nth group is of size T −⌊T∕N⌋(N −1), and
⌊.⌋is the floor or integer function. For a testing set of size k groups, the number of
possible training/testing splits is
(
N
N −k
)
=
∏k−1
i=0 (N −i)
k!
Since each combination involves k tested groups, the total number of tested groups
is k( N
N−k
). And since we have computed all possible combinations, these tested
groups are uniformly distributed across all N (each group belongs to the same num-
ber of training and testing sets). The implication is that from k-sized testing sets on
N groups we can backtest a total number of paths 𝜑[N, k],
𝜑[N, k] = k
N
(
N
N −k
)
=
∏k−1
i=1 (N −i)
(k −1)!
Figure 12.1 illustrates the composition of train/test splits for N = 6 and k = 2.
There are ( 6
4
) = 15 splits, indexed as S1,… ,S15. For each split, the figure marks with
a cross (x) the groups included in the testing set, and leaves unmarked the groups that
form the training set. Each group forms part of 𝜑[6, 2] = 5 testing sets, therefore this
train/test split scheme allows us to compute 5 backtest paths.
Figure 12.2 shows the assignment of each tested group to one backtest path. For
example, path 1 is the result of combining the forecasts from (G1, S1), (G2, S1),

(G3, S2), (G4, S3), (G5, S4) and (G6, S5). Path 2 is the result of combining forecasts
from (G1, S2), (G2, S6), (G3, S6), (G4, S7), (G5, S8) and (G6, S9), and so on.
These paths are generated by training the classifier on a portion 𝜃= 1 −k∕N of the
data for each combination. Although it is theoretically possible to train on a portion
𝜃< 1∕2, in practice we will assume that k ≤N∕2. The portion of data in the training
set 𝜃increases with N →T but it decreases with k →N∕2. The number of paths
𝜑[N, k] increases with N →T and with k →N∕2. In the limit, the largest number of
paths is achieved by setting N = T and k = N∕2 = T∕2, at the expense of training the
classifier on only half of the data for each combination (𝜃= 1∕2).
12.4.2
The Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation Backtesting Algorithm
In Chapter 7 we introduced the concepts of purging and embargoing in the context
of CV. We will now use these concepts for backtesting through CV. The CPCV back-
testing algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. Partition T observations into N groups without shuffling, where groups
n = 1, … , N −1 are of size ⌊T∕N⌋, and the Nth group is of size T −
⌊T∕N⌋(N −1).
2. Compute all possible training/testing splits, where for each split N −k groups
constitute the training set and k groups constitute the testing set.
3. For any pair of labels (yi, yj), where yi belongs to the training set and yj belongs
to the testing set, apply the PurgedKFold class to purge yi if yi spans over a
period used to determine label yj. This class will also apply an embargo, should
some testing samples predate some training samples.
4. Fit classifiers on the ( N
N−k
) training sets, and produce forecasts on the respec-
tive ( N
N−k
) testing sets.
5. Compute the 𝜑[N, k] backtest paths. You can calculate one Sharpe ratio from
each path, and from that derive the empirical distribution of the strategy’s
Sharpe ratio (rather than a single Sharpe ratio, like WF or CV).
12.4.3
A Few Examples
For k = 1, we will obtain 𝜑[N, 1] = 1 path, in which case CPCV reduces to CV. Thus,
CPCV can be understood as a generalization of CV for k > 1.
For k = 2, we will obtain 𝜑[N, 2] = N −1 paths. This is a particularly interesting
case, because while training the classifier on a large portion of the data, 𝜃= 1 −2∕N,
we can generate almost as many backtest paths as the number of groups, N −1. An
easy rule of thumb is to partition the data into N = 𝜑+ 1 groups, where 𝜑is the
number of paths we target, and then form ( N
N−2
) combinations. In the limit, we can
assign one group per observation, N = T, and generate 𝜑[T, 2] = T −1 paths, while
training the classifier on a portion 𝜃= 1 −2∕T of the data per combination.

## Page 193

166
BACKTESTING THROUGH CROSS-VALIDATION
If even more paths are needed, we can increase k →N∕2, but as explained earlier
that will come at the cost of using a smaller portion of the dataset for training. In prac-
tice, k = 2 is often enough to generate the needed 𝜑paths, by setting N = 𝜑+ 1 ≤T.
12.5
HOW COMBINATORIAL PURGED CROSS-VALIDATION
ADDRESSES BACKTEST OVERFITTING
Given a sample of IID random variables, xi ∼Z, i = 1, … , I, where Z is the standard
normal distribution, the expected maximum of that sample can be approximated as
E[max{xi}i=1,…,I] ≈(1 −𝛾) Z−1 [
1 −1
I
]
+ 𝛾Z−1 [
1 −1
I e−1]
≤
√
2log [I]
where Z−1 [.] is the inverse of the CDF of Z, 𝛾≈0.5772156649 ⋯is the Euler-
Mascheroni constant, and I ≫1 (see Bailey et al. [2014] for a proof). Now suppose
that a researcher backtests I strategies on an instrument that behaves like a martingale,
with Sharpe ratios {yi}i=1,…,I, E[yi] = 0, 𝜎2[yi] > 0, and
yi
𝜎[yi] ∼Z. Even though the
true Sharpe ratio is zero, we expect to find one strategy with a Sharpe ratio of
E[max{yi}i=1,…,I] = E[max{xi}i=1,…,I]𝜎[yi]
WF backtests exhibit high variance, 𝜎[yi] ≫0, for at least one reason: A large
portion of the decisions are based on a small portion of the dataset. A few observations
will have a large weight on the Sharpe ratio. Using a warm-up period will reduce the
backtest length, which may contribute to making the variance even higher. WF’s high
variance leads to false discoveries, because researchers will select the backtest with
the maximum estimated Sharpe ratio, even if the true Sharpe ratio is zero. That is
the reason it is imperative to control for the number of trials (I) in the context of WF
backtesting. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the Family-Wise
Error Rate (FWER), False Discovery Rate (FDR), Probability of Backtest Overfitting
(PBO, see Chapter 11) or similar model assessment statistic.
CV backtests (Section 12.3) address that source of variance by training each clas-
sifier on equal and large portions of the dataset. Although CV leads to fewer false
discoveries than WF, both approaches still estimate the Sharpe ratio from a single
path for a strategy i, yi, and that estimation may be highly volatile. In contrast, CPCV
derives the distribution of Sharpe ratios from a large number of paths, j = 1, … , 𝜑,
with mean E[{yi,j}j=1,…,𝜑] = 𝜇i and variance 𝜎2[{yi,j}j=1,…,𝜑] = 𝜎2
i . The variance of
the sample mean of CPCV paths is
𝜎2[𝜇i] = 𝜑−2 (𝜑𝜎2
i + 𝜑(𝜑−1) 𝜎2
ī 𝜌i
) = 𝜑−1𝜎2
i
(1 + (𝜑−1)̄ 𝜌i
)
where 𝜎2
i is the variance of the Sharpe ratios across paths for strategy i, and̄ 𝜌i is
the average off-diagonal correlation among {yi,j}j=1,…,𝜑. CPCV leads to fewer false

## Page 194

EXERCISES
167
discoveries than CV and WF, becausē 𝜌i < 1 implies that the variance of the sample
mean is lower than the variance of the sample,
𝜑−1𝜎2
i ≤𝜎2 [𝜇i
] < 𝜎2
i
The more uncorrelated the paths are,̄ 𝜌i ≪1, the lower CPCV’s variance will be,
and in the limit CPCV will report the true Sharpe ratio E[yi] with zero variance,
lim𝜑→∞𝜎2[𝜇i] = 0. There will not be selection bias, because the strategy selected
out of i = 1, … , I will be the one with the highest true Sharpe ratio.
Of course, we know that zero variance is unachievable, since 𝜑has an upper bound,
𝜑≤𝜑[T, T
2
]. Still, for a large enough number of paths 𝜑, CPCV could make the vari-
ance of the backtest so small as to make the probability of a false discovery negligible.
In Chapter 11, we argued that backtest overfitting may be the most important open
problem in all of mathematical finance. Let us see how CPCV helps address this prob-
lem in practice. Suppose that a researcher submits a strategy to a journal, supported
by an overfit WF backtest, selected from a large number of undisclosed trials. The
journal could ask the researcher to repeat his experiments using a CPCV for a given N
and k. Because the researcher did not know in advance the number and characteristics
of the paths to be backtested, his overfitting efforts will be easily defeated. The paper
will be rejected or withdrawn from consideration. Hopefully CPCV will be used to
reduce the number of false discoveries published in journals and elsewhere.
EXERCISES
12.1 Suppose that you develop a momentum strategy on a futures contract, where
the forecast is based on an AR(1) process. You backtest this strategy using the
WF method, and the Sharpe ratio is 1.5. You then repeat the backtest on the
reversed series and achieve a Sharpe ratio of –1.5. What would be the mathe-
matical grounds for disregarding the second result, if any?
12.2 You develop a mean-reverting strategy on a futures contract. Your WF backtest
achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.5. You increase the length of the warm-up period,
and the Sharpe ratio drops to 0.7. You go ahead and present only the result with
the higher Sharpe ratio, arguing that a strategy with a shorter warm-up is more

12.3 Your strategy achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 on a WF backtest, but a Sharpe

it to an academic journal. The editor replies that one referee has requested you
repeat your backtest using a CPCV method with N = 100 and k = 2, including
your code and full datasets. You follow these instructions, and the mean Sharpe
ratio is –1 with a standard deviation of 0.5. Furious, you do not reply, but instead
withdraw your submission, and resubmit in a different journal of higher impact
factor. After 6 months, your paper is accepted. You appease your conscience
thinking that, if the discovery is false, it is the journal’s fault for not having
requested a CPCV test. You think, “It cannot be unethical, since it is permitted,
and everybody does it.” What are the arguments, scientific or ethical, to justify
your actions?

CHAPTER 13
Backtesting on Synthetic Data
13.1
MOTIVATION
In this chapter we will study an alternative backtesting method, which uses his-
tory to generate a synthetic dataset with statistical characteristics estimated from the
observed data. This will allow us to backtest a strategy on a large number of unseen,
synthetic testing sets, hence reducing the likelihood that the strategy has been fit to
a particular set of datapoints.1 This is a very extensive subject, and in order to reach
some depth we will focus on the backtesting of trading rules.
13.2
TRADING RULES
Investment strategies can be defined as algorithms that postulate the existence of a
market inefficiency. Some strategies rely on econometric models to predict prices,
using macroeconomic variables such as GDP or inflation; other strategies use fun-
damental and accounting information to price securities, or search for arbitrage-like
opportunities in the pricing of derivatives products, etc. For instance, suppose that
financial intermediaries tend to sell off-the-run bonds two days before U.S. Treasury
auctions, in order to raise the cash needed for buying the new “paper.” One could
monetize on that knowledge by selling off-the-run bonds three days before auctions.
But how? Each investment strategy requires an implementation tactic, often referred
to as “trading rules.”
There are dozens of hedge fund styles, each running dozens of unique investment
strategies. While strategies can be very heterogeneous in nature, tactics are relatively
homogeneous. Trading rules provide the algorithm that must be followed to enter
and exit a position. For example, a position will be entered when the strategy’s signal

BACKTESTING ON SYNTHETIC DATA
reaches a certain value. Conditions for exiting a position are often defined through
thresholds for profit-taking and stop-losses. These entry and exit rules rely on param-
eters that are usually calibrated via historical simulations. This practice leads to the
problem of backtest overfitting, because these parameters target specific observations
in-sample, to the point that the investment strategy is so attached to the past that it
becomes unfit for the future.
An important clarification is that we are interested in the exit corridor conditions
that maximize performance. In other words, the position already exists, and the ques-
tion is how to exit it optimally. This is the dilemma often faced by execution traders,
and it should not be mistaken with the determination of entry and exit thresholds
for investing in a security. For a study of that alternative question, see, for example,
Bertram [2009].
Bailey et al. [2014, 2017] discuss the problem of backtest overfitting, and provide
methods to determine to what extent a simulated performance may be inflated due
to overfitting. While assessing the probability of backtest overfitting is a useful tool
to discard superfluous investment strategies, it would be better to avoid the risk of
overfitting, at least in the context of calibrating a trading rule. In theory this could be
accomplished by deriving the optimal parameters for the trading rule directly from
the stochastic process that generates the data, rather than engaging in historical sim-
ulations. This is the approach we take in this chapter. Using the entire historical sam-
ple, we will characterize the stochastic process that generates the observed stream
of returns, and derive the optimal values for the trading rule’s parameters without
requiring a historical simulation.
13.3
THE PROBLEM
Suppose an investment strategy S invests in i = 1, … I opportunities or bets. At each
opportunity i, S takes a position of mi units of security X, where mi ∈(−∞, ∞). The
transaction that entered such opportunity was priced at a value miPi,0, where Pi,0
is the average price per unit at which the mi securities were transacted. As other
market participants transact security X, we can mark-to-market (MtM) the value of
that opportunity i after t observed transactions as miPi,t. This represents the value of
opportunity i if it were liquidated at the price observed in the market after t trans-
actions. Accordingly, we can compute the MtM profit/loss of opportunity i after t
transactions as 𝜋i,t = mi(Pi,t −Pi,0).
A standard trading rule provides the logic for exiting opportunity i at t = Ti. This
occurs as soon as one of two conditions is verified:
r 𝜋i,Ti ≥̄ 𝜋, wherē 𝜋> 0 is the profit-taking threshold.
r 𝜋i,Ti ≤𝜋, where 𝜋< 0 is the stop-loss threshold.
These thresholds are equivalent to the horizontal barriers we discussed in the con-
text of meta-labelling (Chapter 3). Because 𝜋<̄ 𝜋, one and only one of the two exit
conditions can trigger the exit from opportunity i. Assuming that opportunity i can

## Page 198

THE PROBLEM
171
be exited at Ti, its final profit/loss is 𝜋i,Ti. At the onset of each opportunity, the goal
is to realize an expected profit E0[𝜋i,Ti] = mi(E0[Pi,Ti] −Pi,0), where E0[Pi,Ti] is the
forecasted price and Pi,0 is the entry level of opportunity i.
Definition 1: Trading Rule: A trading rule for strategy S is defined by the set of
parameters R := {𝜋,̄ 𝜋}.
One way to calibrate (by brute force) the trading rule is to:
1. Define a set of alternative values of R, Ω := {R}.
2. Simulate historically (backtest) the performance of S under alternative values
of R ∈Ω.
3. Select the optimal R∗.
More formally:
R∗= arg max
R∈Ω{SRR}
SRR =
E[𝜋i,Ti|R]
𝜎[𝜋i,Ti|R]
(13.1)
where E [.] and 𝜎[.] are respectively the expected value and standard deviation of
𝜋i,Ti, conditional on trading rule R, over i = 1, … I. In other words, equation (13.1)
maximizes the Sharpe ratio of S on I opportunities over the space of alternative trading
rules R (see Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012] for a definition and analysis of the
Sharpe ratio). Because we count with two variables to maximize SRR over a sample
of size I, it is easy to overfit R. A trivial overfit occurs when a pair (𝜋,̄ 𝜋) targets a
few outliers. Bailey et al. [2017] provide a rigorous definition of backtest overfitting,
which can be applied to our study of trading rules as follows.
Definition 2: Overfit Trading Rule: R∗is overfit if E

, where j = I + 1, … J and MeΩ [.] is the median.
Intuitively, an optimal in-sample (IS, i ∈[1, I]) trading rule R∗is overfit when it
is expected to underperform the median of alternative trading rules R ∈Ω out-of-
sample (OOS, j ∈[I + 1, J]). This is essentially the same definition we used in chap-
ter 11 to derive PBO. Bailey et al. [2014] argue that it is hard not to overfit a backtest,
particularly when there are free variables able to target specific observations IS, or
the number of elements in Ω is large. A trading rule introduces such free variables,

## Page 199

172
BACKTESTING ON SYNTHETIC DATA
because R∗can be determined independently from S. The outcome is that the backtest
profits from random noise IS, making R∗unfit for OOS opportunities. Those same
authors show that overfitting leads to negative performance OOS when Δ𝜋i,t exhibits
serial dependence. While PBO provides a useful method to evaluate to what extent
a backtest has been overfit, it would be convenient to avoid this problem in the first
place.2 To that aim we dedicate the following section.
13.4
OUR FRAMEWORK
Until now we have not characterized the stochastic process from which observations
𝜋i,t are drawn. We are interested in finding an optimal trading rule (OTR) for those
scenarios where overfitting would be most damaging, such as when 𝜋i,t exhibits serial
correlation. In particular, suppose a discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process on
prices
Pi,t = (1 −𝜑) E0[Pi,Ti] + 𝜑Pi,t−1 + 𝜎𝜀i,t
(13.2)
such that the random shocks are IID distributed 𝜀i,t ∼N (0, 1). The seed value for
this process is Pi,0, the level targeted by opportunity i is E0[Pi,Ti], and 𝜑determines
the speed at which Pi,0 converges towards E0[Pi,Ti]. Because 𝜋i,t = mi(Pi,t −Pi,0),
equation (13.2) implies that the performance of opportunity i is characterized by the
process
1
mi
𝜋i,t = (1 −𝜑)E0[Pi,Ti] −Pi,0 + 𝜑Pi,t−1 + 𝜎𝜀i,t
(13.3)
From the proof to Proposition 4 in Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2013], it can be
shown that the distribution of the process specified in equation (13.2) is Gaussian
with parameters
𝜋i,t ∼N
[
mi

∑
j=0

)
, m2

]
(13.4)
and a necessary and sufficient condition for its stationarity is that 𝜑∈(−1, 1). Given a
set of input parameters {𝜎, 𝜑} and initial conditions {Pi,0, E0[Pi,Ti]} associated with
opportunity i, is there an OTR R∗:= (𝜋,̄ 𝜋)? Similarly, should strategy S predict a
profit target̄ 𝜋, can we compute the optimal stop-loss 𝜋given the input values {𝜎, 𝜑}?
If the answer to these questions is affirmative, no backtest would be needed in order
to determine R∗, thus avoiding the problem of overfitting the trading rule. In the next
section we will show how to answer these questions experimentally.
2 The strategy may still be the result of backtest overfitting, but at least the trading rule would not have
contributed to that problem.

NUMERICAL DETERMINATION OF OPTIMAL TRADING RULES
In the previous section we used an O-U specification to characterize the stochastic
process generating the returns of strategy S. In this section we will present a pro-
cedure to numerically derive the OTR for any specification in general, and the O-U
specification in particular.
13.5.1
The Algorithm
The algorithm consists of five sequential steps.
Step 1: We estimate the input parameters {𝜎, 𝜑}, by linearizing equation (13.2)
as:
Pi,t = E0[Pi,Ti] + 𝜑(Pi,t−1 −E0[Pi,Ti]) + 𝜉t
(13.5)
We can then form vectors X and Y by sequencing opportunities:
X =

⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥⎦
(13.6)
Applying OLS on equation (13.5), we can estimate the original O-U parameters
as,̂
𝜑= cov [Y, X]
cov [X, X]̂
𝜉t = Y −Z −̂ 𝜑X
(13.7)̂
𝜎=
√
cov[̂𝜉t,̂ 𝜉t]
where cov [⋅, ⋅] is the covariance operator.
Step 2: We construct a mesh of stop-loss and profit-taking pairs, (𝜋,̄ 𝜋).
For example, a Cartesian product of 𝜋= {−1
2𝜎, −𝜎, … , −10𝜎} and̄ 𝜋=
{ 1
2𝜎, 𝜎, … , 10𝜎} give us 20 × 20 nodes, each constituting an alternative trading
rule R ∈Ω.

## Page 201

174
BACKTESTING ON SYNTHETIC DATA
Step 3: We generate a large number of paths (e.g., 100,000) for 𝜋i,t applying
our estimates {̂𝜎,̂ 𝜑}. As seed values, we use the observed initial conditions
{Pi,0, E0[Pi,Ti]} associated with an opportunity i. Because a position cannot
be held for an unlimited period of time, we can impose a maximum holding
period (e.g., 100 observations) at which point the position is exited even though
𝜋≤𝜋i,100 ≤̄ 𝜋. This maximum holding period is equivalent to the vertical bar
of the triple-barrier method (Chapter 3).3
Step 4: We apply the 100,000 paths generated in Step 3 on each node of the 20 ×
20 mesh (𝜋,̄ 𝜋) generated in Step 2. For each node, we apply the stop-loss and
profit-taking logic, giving us 100,000 values of 𝜋i,Ti. Likewise, for each node
we compute the Sharpe ratio associated with that trading rule as described in
equation (13.1). See Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012] for a study of the con-
fidence interval of the Sharpe ratio estimator. This result can be used in three
different ways: Step 5a, Step 5b and Step 5c).
Step 5a: We determine the pair (𝜋,̄ 𝜋) within the mesh of trading rules that is
optimal, given the input parameters {̂𝜎,̂ 𝜑} and the observed initial conditions
{Pi,0, E0[Pi,Ti]}.
Step 5b: If strategy S provides a profit target 𝜋i for a particular opportunity i, we
can use that information in conjunction with the results in Step 4 to determine
the optimal stop-loss, 𝜋i.
Step 5c: If the trader has a maximum stop-loss 𝜋i imposed by the fund’s man-
agement for opportunity i, we can use that information in conjunction with the
results in Step 4 to determine the optimal profit-taking 𝜋i within the range of
stop-losses [0, 𝜋i].
Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2013] prove that the half-life of the process in equation
(13.2) is 𝜏= −log[2]
log[𝜑], with the requirement that 𝜑∈(0, 1). From that result, we can
determine the value of 𝜑associated with a certain half-life 𝜏as 𝜑= 2
−1∕𝜏.
13.5.2
Implementation
Snippet 13.1 provides an implementation in Python of the experiments conducted in
this chapter. Function main produces a Cartesian product of parameters (E0[Pi,Ti], 𝜏),
which characterize the stochastic process from equation (13.5). Without loss of gen-
erality, in all simulations we have used 𝜎= 1. Then, for each pair (E0[Pi,Ti], 𝜏),
function batch computes the Sharpe ratios associated with various trading
rules.
3 The trading rule R could be characterized as a function of the three barriers, instead of the horizontal
ones. That change would have no impact on the procedure. It would merely add one more dimension
to the mesh (20 × 20 × 20). In this chapter we do not consider that setting, because it would make the
visualization of the method less intuitive.

Snippet 13.2 computes a 20 × 20 mesh of Sharpe ratios, one for each trading
rule (𝜋,̄ 𝜋), given a pair of parameters (E0[Pi,Ti], 𝜏). There is a vertical barrier, as the
maximum holding period is set at 100 (maxHP= 100). We have fixed Pi,0 = 0, since it
is the distance (Pi,t−1 −E0[Pi,Ti]) in equation (13.5) that drives the convergence, not
particular absolute price levels. Once the first out of three barriers is touched, the exit
price is stored, and the next iteration starts. After all iterations are completed (1E5),
the Sharpe ratio can be computed for that pair (𝜋,̄ 𝜋), and the algorithm moves to the
next pair. When all pairs of trading rules have been processed, results are reported
back to main. This algorithm can be parallelized, similar to what we did for the triple-
barrier method in Chapter 3. We leave that task as an exercise.

are represented in grayscale (lighter indicating better performance; darker indicat-
ing worse performance), in a format known as a heat-map. Performance (𝜋i,Ti) is
computed per unit held (mi = 1), since other values of mi would simply re-scale per-
formance, with no impact on the Sharpe ratio. Transaction costs can be easily added,
but for educational purposes it is better to plot results without them, so that you can
appreciate the symmetry of the functions.
13.6.1
Cases with Zero Long-Run Equilibrium
Cases with zero long-run equilibrium are consistent with the business of market-
makers, who provide liquidity under the assumption that price deviations from current
levels will correct themselves over time. The smaller 𝜏, the smaller is the autoregres-
sive coefficient (𝜑= 2
−1∕𝜏). A small autoregressive coefficient in conjunction with
a zero expected profit has the effect that most of the pairs (𝜋i, 𝜋i) deliver a zero
performance.
Figure 13.1 shows the heat-map for the parameter combination {E0[Pi,Ti], 𝜏, 𝜎} =
{0, 5, 1}. The half-life is so small that performance is maximized in a narrow range of
combinations of small profit-taking with large stop-losses. In other words, the optimal
trading rule is to hold an inventory long enough until a small profit arises, even at the
expense of experiencing some 5-fold or 7-fold unrealized losses. Sharpe ratios are

high, reaching levels of around 3.2. This is in fact what many market-makers do in
practice, and is consistent with the “asymmetric payoff dilemma” described in Easley
et al. [2011]. The worst possible trading rule in this setting would be to combine a
short stop-loss with a large profit-taking threshold, a situation that market-makers
avoid in practice. Performance is closest to neutral in the diagonal of the mesh, where
profit-taking and stop-losses are symmetric. You should keep this result in mind when
labeling observations using the triple-barrier method (Chapter 3).

lowest performance spread over the mesh of pairs (𝜋,̄ 𝜋), while the Sharpe ratios
decrease. This is because, as the half-life increases, so does the magnitude of the
autoregressive coefficient (recall that 𝜑= 2
−1∕𝜏), thus bringing the process closer to
a random walk.
In Figure 13.3, 𝜏= 25, which again spreads the areas of highest and lowest per-
formance while reducing the Sharpe ratio. Figure 13.4 (𝜏= 50) and Figure 13.5
(𝜏= 100) continue that progression. Eventually, as 𝜑→1, there are no recognizable
areas where performance can be maximized.
Calibrating a trading rule on a random walk through historical simulations would
lead to backtest overfitting, because one random combination of profit-taking and
stop-loss that happened to maximize Sharpe ratio would be selected. This is why
backtesting of synthetic data is so important: to avoid choosing a strategy because
some statistical fluke took place in the past (a single random path). Our procedure

prevents overfitting by recognizing that performance exhibits no consistent pattern,
indicating that there is no optimal trading rule.
13.6.2
Cases with Positive Long-Run Equilibrium
Cases with positive long-run equilibrium are consistent with the business of a
position-taker, such as a hedge-fund or asset manager. Figure 13.6 shows the results
for the parameter combination {E0[Pi,Ti], 𝜏, 𝜎} = {5, 5, 1}. Because positions tend to
make money, the optimal profit-taking is higher than in the previous cases, centered
around 6, with stop-losses that range between 4 and 10. The region of the optimal
trading rule takes a characteristic rectangular shape, as a result of combining a wide
stop-loss range with a narrower profit-taking range. Performance is highest across all
experiments, with Sharpe ratios of around 12.
In Figure 13.7, we have increased the half-life from 𝜏= 5 to 𝜏= 10. Now the opti-
mal performance is achieved at a profit-taking centered around 5, with stop-losses that
range between 7 and 10. The range of optimal profit-taking is wider, while the range of
optimal stop-losses narrows, shaping the former rectangular area closer to a square.
Again, a larger half-life brings the process closer to a random walk, and therefore
performance is now relatively lower than before, with Sharpe ratios of around 9.
In Figure 13.8, we have made 𝜏= 25. The optimal profit-taking is now centered
around 3, while the optimal stop-losses range between 9 and 10. The previous squared

area of optimal performance has given way to a semi-circle of small profit-taking with
large stop-loss thresholds. Again we see a deterioration of performance, with Sharpe
ratios of 2.7.
In Figure 13.9, the half-life is raised to 𝜏= 50. As a result, the region of optimal
performance spreads, while Sharpe ratios continue to fall to 0.8. This is the same
effect we observed in the case of zero long-run equilibrium (Section 13.6.1), with
the difference that because now E0[Pi,Ti] > 0, there is no symmetric area of worst
performance.
In Figure 13.10, we appreciate that 𝜏= 100 leads to the natural conclusion of
the trend described above. The process is now so close to a random walk that the
maximum Sharpe ratio is a mere 0.32.
We can observe a similar pattern in Figures 13.11 through 13.15, where E0[Pi,Ti] =
10 and 𝜏is progressively increased from 5 to 10, 25, 50, and 100, respectively.
13.6.3
Cases with Negative Long-Run Equilibrium
A rational market participant would not initiate a position under the assumption that
a loss is the expected outcome. However, if a trader recognizes that losses are the
expected outcome of a pre-existing position, she still needs a strategy to stop-out that
position while minimizing such losses.

appears as if one is a rotated complementary of the other. Figure 13.6 resembles a
rotated photographic negative of Figure 13.16. The reason is that the profit in Figure
13.6 is translated into a loss in Figure 13.16, and the loss in Figure 13.6 is translated
into a profit in Figure 13.16. One case is a reverse image of the other, just as a
gambler’s loss is the house’s gain.
As expected, Sharpe ratios are negative, with a worst performance region centered
around the stop-loss of 6, and profit-taking thresholds that range between 4 and 10.
Now the rectangular shape does not correspond to a region of best performance, but
to a region of worst performance, with Sharpe ratios of around −12.
In Figure 13.17, 𝜏= 10, and now the proximity to a random walk plays in our
favor. The region of worst performance spreads out, and the rectangular area becomes
a square. Performance becomes less negative, with Sharpe ratios of about −9.
This familiar progression can be appreciated in Figures 13.18, 13.19, and 13.20,
as 𝜏is raised to 25, 50, and 100. Again, as the process approaches a random walk,
performance flattens and optimizing the trading rule becomes a backtest-overfitting
exercise.
Figures 13.21 through 13.25 repeat the same process for E0[Pi,Ti] = −10 and 𝜏
that is progressively increased from 5 to 10, 25, 50, and 100. The same pattern, a
rotated complementary to the case of positive long-run equilibrium, arises.

BACKTESTING ON SYNTHETIC DATA
13.7
CONCLUSION
In this chapter we have shown how to determine experimentally the optimal trading
strategy associated with prices following a discrete O-U process. Because the deriva-
tion of such trading strategy is not the result of a historical simulation, our procedure
avoids the risks associated with overfitting the backtest to a single path. Instead, the
optimal trading rule is derived from the characteristics of the underlying stochastic
process that drives prices. The same approach can be applied to processes other than
O-U, and we have focused on this particular process only for educational purposes.
While we do not derive the closed-form solution to the optimal trading strategies
problem in this chapter, our experimental results seem to support the following OTR
conjecture:
Conjecture: Given a financial instrument’s price characterized by a discrete
O-U process, there is a unique optimal trading rule in terms of a combination
of profit-taking and stop-loss that maximizes the rule’s Sharpe ratio.
Given that these optimal trading rules can be derived numerically within a few
seconds, there is little practical incentive to obtain a closed-form solution. As it is
becoming more common in mathematical research, the experimental analysis of a
conjecture can help us achieve a goal even in the absence of a proof. It could take years
if not decades to prove the above conjecture, and yet all experiments conducted so
far confirm it empirically. Let me put it this way: The probability that this conjecture
is false is negligible relative to the probability that you will overfit your trading rule
by disregarding the conjecture. Hence, the rational course of action is to assume that
the conjecture is right, and determine the OTR through synthetic data. In the worst
case, the trading rule will be suboptimal, but still it will almost surely outperform an
overfit trading rule.
EXERCISES
13.1 Suppose you are an execution trader. A client calls you with an order to cover a
short position she entered at a price of 100. She gives you two exit conditions:
profit-taking at 90 and stop-loss at 105.
(a) Assuming the client believes the price follows an O-U process, are these
levels reasonable? For what parameters?
(b) Can you think of an alternative stochastic process under which these levels
make sense?
13.2 Fit the time series of dollar bars of E-mini S&P 500 futures to an O-U process.
Given those parameters:
(a) Produce a heat-map of Sharpe ratios for various profit-taking and stop-loss
levels.
(b) What is the OTR?

193
13.3 Repeat exercise 2, this time on a time series of dollar bars of
(a) 10-year U.S. Treasure Notes futures
(b) WTI Crude Oil futures
(c) Are the results significantly different? Does this justify having execution
traders specialized by product?
13.4 Repeat exercise 2 after splitting the time series into two parts:
(a) The first time series ends on 3/15/2009.
(b) The second time series starts on 3/16/2009.
(c) Are the OTRs significantly different?
13.5 How long do you estimate it would take to derive OTRs on the 100 most liquid
futures contracts worldwide? Considering the results from exercise 4, how often
do you think you may have to re-calibrate the OTRs? Does it make sense to pre-
compute this data?

CHAPTER 14
Backtest Statistics
14.1
MOTIVATION
In the previous chapters, we have studied three backtesting paradigms: First, histor-
ical simulations (the walk-forward method, Chapters 11 and 12). Second, scenario
simulations (CV and CPCV methods, Chapter 12). Third, simulations on synthetic
data (Chapter 13). Regardless of the backtesting paradigm you choose, you need to
report the results according to a series of statistics that investors will use to compare
and judge your strategy against competitors. In this chapter we will discuss some
of the most commonly used performance evaluation statistics. Some of these statis-
tics are included in the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS),1 however a
comprehensive analysis of performance requires metrics specific to the ML strategies
under scrutiny.
14.2
TYPES OF BACKTEST STATISTICS
Backtest statistics comprise metrics used by investors to assess and compare various
investment strategies. They should help us uncover potentially problematic aspects of
the strategy, such as substantial asymmetric risks or low capacity. Overall, they can be
categorized into general characteristics, performance, runs/drawdowns, implementa-
tion shortfall, return/risk efficiency, classification scores, and attribution.

BACKTEST STATISTICS
14.3
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
The following statistics inform us about the general characteristics of the backtest:
r Time range: Time range specifies the start and end dates. The period used to
test the strategy should be sufficiently long to include a comprehensive number
of regimes (Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012]).
r Average AUM: This is the average dollar value of the assets under manage-
ment. For the purpose of computing this average, the dollar value of long and
short positions is considered to be a positive real number.
r Capacity: A strategy’s capacity can be measured as the highest AUM that deliv-
ers a target risk-adjusted performance. A minimum AUM is needed to ensure
proper bet sizing (Chapter 10) and risk diversification (Chapter 16). Beyond
that minimum AUM, performance will decay as AUM increases, due to higher
transaction costs and lower turnover.
r Leverage: Leverage measures the amount of borrowing needed to achieve the
reported performance. If leverage takes place, costs must be assigned to it. One
way to measure leverage is as the ratio of average dollar position size to average
AUM.
r Maximum dollar position size: Maximum dollar position size informs us
whether the strategy at times took dollar positions that greatly exceeded the
average AUM. In general we will prefer strategies that take maximum dollar
positions close to the average AUM, indicating that they do not rely on the
occurrence of extreme events (possibly outliers).
r Ratio of longs: The ratio of longs show what proportion of the bets involved
long positions. In long-short, market neutral strategies, ideally this value is close
to 0.5. If not, the strategy may have a position bias, or the backtested period may
be too short and unrepresentative of future market conditions.
r Frequency of bets: The frequency of bets is the number of bets per year in
the backtest. A sequence of positions on the same side is considered part of the
same bet. A bet ends when the position is flattened or flipped to the opposite
side. The number of bets is always smaller than the number of trades. A trade
count would overestimate the number of independent opportunities discovered
by the strategy.
r Average holding period: The average holding period is the average number of
days a bet is held. High-frequency strategies may hold a position for a fraction
of seconds, whereas low frequency strategies may hold a position for months
or even years. Short holding periods may limit the capacity of the strategy. The
holding period is related but different to the frequency of bets. For example,
a strategy may place bets on a monthly basis, around the release of nonfarm
payrolls data, where each bet is held for only a few minutes.
r Annualized turnover: Annualized turnover measures the ratio of the average
dollar amount traded per year to the average annual AUM. High turnover may
occur even with a low number of bets, as the strategy may require constant
tuning of the position. High turnover may also occur with a low number of

## Page 224

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
197
trades, if every trade involves flipping the position between maximum long and
maximum short.
r Correlation to underlying: This is the correlation between strategy returns
and the returns of the underlying investment universe. When the correlation is
significantly positive or negative, the strategy is essentially holding or short-
selling the investment universe, without adding much value.
Snippet 14.1 lists an algorithm that derives the timestamps of flattening or flipping
trades from a pandas series of target positions (tPos). This gives us the number of
bets that have taken place.

BACKTEST STATISTICS

PERFORMANCE
Performance statistics are dollar and returns numbers without risk adjustments. Some
useful performance measurements include:
r PnL: The total amount of dollars (or the equivalent in the currency of denom-
ination) generated over the entirety of the backtest, including liquidation costs
from the terminal position.
r PnL from long positions: The portion of the PnL dollars that was generated
exclusively by long positions. This is an interesting value for assessing the bias
of long-short, market neutral strategies.
r Annualized rate of return: The time-weighted average annual rate of total
return, including dividends, coupons, costs, etc.
r Hit ratio: The fraction of bets that resulted in a positive PnL.
r Average return from hits: The average return from bets that generated a profit.
r Average return from misses: The average return from bets that generated a
loss.
14.4.1
Time-Weighted Rate of Return
Total return is the rate of return from realized and unrealized gains and losses,
including accrued interest, paid coupons, and dividends for the measurement
period. GIPS rules calculate time-weighted rate of returns (TWRR), adjusted for
external cash flows (CFA Institute [2010]). Periodic and sub-periodic returns are
geometrically linked. For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005, GIPS
rules mandate calculating portfolio returns that adjust for daily-weighted external
cash flows.
We can compute the TWRR by determining the value of the portfolio at the time
of each external cash flow.2 The TWRR for portfolio i between subperiods [t −1, t]
is denoted ri,t, with equations
ri,t =
𝜋i,t
Ki,t
𝜋i,t =
J∑
j=1
[(ΔPj,t + Aj,t)𝜃i,j,t−1 + Δ𝜃i,j,t(Pj,t −Pj,t−1)]
Ki,t =
J∑
j=1̃
Pj,t−1𝜃i,j,t−1 + max
{
0,
J∑
j=1̃
Pj,tΔ𝜃i,j,t
}
2 External cash flows are assets (cash or investments) that enter or exit a portfolio. Dividend and interest
income payments, for example, are not considered external cash flows.

## Page 226

where
r 𝜋i,t is the mark-to-market (MtM) profit or loss for portfolio i at time t.
r Ki,t is the market value of the assets under management by portfolio i through
subperiod t. The purpose of including the max {.} term is to fund additional
purchases (ramp-up).
r Aj,t is the interest accrued or dividend paid by one unit of instrument j at time t.
r Pj,t is the clean price of security j at time t.
r 𝜃i,j,t are the holdings of portfolio i on security j at time t.
r̃ Pj,t is the dirty price of security j at time t.
r Pj,t is the average transacted clean price of portfolio i on security j over subpe-
riod t.
r̃ Pj,t is the average transacted dirty price of portfolio i on security j over subperiod
t.
Cash inflows are assumed to occur at the beginning of the day, and cash outflows
are assumed to occur at the end of the day. These sub-period returns are then linked
geometrically as
𝜑i,T =
T
∏
t=1
(1 + ri,t)
The variable 𝜑i,T can be understood as the performance of one dollar invested in
portfolio i over its entire life, t = 1, … , T. Finally, the annualized rate of return of
portfolio i is
Ri = (𝜑i,T)−yi −1
where yi is the number of years elapsed between ri,1 and ri,T.
14.5
RUNS
Investment strategies rarely generate returns drawn from an IID process. In the
absence of this property, strategy returns series exhibit frequent runs. Runs are unin-
terrupted sequences of returns of the same sign. Consequently, runs increase down-
side risk, which needs to be evaluated with proper metrics.
14.5.1
Returns Concentration
Given a time series of returns from bets, {rt}t=1,…,T, we compute two weight series,
w−and w+:
r+ = {rt|rt ≥0}t=1,…,T
r−= {rt|rt < 0}t=1,…,T

Inspired by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), for ||w+|| > 1, where ||.|| is the
size of the vector, we define the concentration of positive returns as
h+ ≡
∑
t
(w+

)2 −||w+||−1
1 −||w+||−1
=
⎛

⎞
⎟

(||r+|| −1)−1
and the equivalent for concentration of negative returns, for ||w−|| > 1, as
h−≡
∑

(w−

1 −||w−||−1
=

(||r−|| −1)−1
From Jensen’s inequality, we know that E[r+
t ]2 ≤E[(r+
t )2]. And because
E[(r+
t )2]
E[r+
t ]2 ≤
||r+||, we deduce that E[r+
t ]2 ≤E[(r+
t )2] ≤E[r+
t ]2||r+||, with an equivalent bound-
ary on negative bet returns. These definitions have a few interesting properties:
1. 0 ≤h+ ≤1
2. h+ = 0 ⇔w+
t = ||w+||−1, ∀t (uniform returns)
3. h+ = 1 ⇔∃i|w+
i = ∑
t w+
t (only one non-zero return)
It is easy to derive a similar expression for the concentration of bets across months,
h [t]. Snippet 14.3 implements these concepts. Ideally, we are interested in strategies
where bets’ returns exhibit:
r high Sharpe ratio
r high number of bets per year, ||r+|| + ||r−|| = T
r high hit ratio (relatively low ||r−||)
r low h+ (no right fat-tail)
r low h−(no left fat-tail)
r low h [t] (bets are not concentrated in time)

Drawdown and Time under Water
Intuitively, a drawdown (DD) is the maximum loss suffered by an investment between
two consecutive high-watermarks (HWMs). The time under water (TuW) is the time
elapsed between an HWM and the moment the PnL exceeds the previous maximum
PnL. These concepts are best understood by reading Snippet 14.4. This code derives
both DD and TuW series from either (1) the series of returns (dollars= False)
or; (2) the series of dollar performance (dollar= True). Figure 14.1 provides an
example of DD and TuW.

IMPLEMENTATION SHORTFALL
Investment strategies often fail due to wrong assumptions regarding execution costs.
Some important measurements of this include:
r Broker fees per turnover: These are the fees paid to the broker for turning the
portfolio over, including exchange fees.
r Average slippage per turnover: These are execution costs, excluding broker
fees, involved in one portfolio turnover. For example, it includes the loss caused
by buying a security at a fill-price higher than the mid-price at the moment the
order was sent to the execution broker.
r Dollar performance per turnover: This is the ratio between dollar per-
formance (including brokerage fees and slippage costs) and total portfolio
turnovers. It signifies how much costlier the execution could become before
the strategy breaks even.

r Return on execution costs: This is the ratio between dollar performance
(including brokerage fees and slippage costs) and total execution costs. It should
be a large multiple, to ensure that the strategy will survive worse-than-expected

EFFICIENCY
Until now, all performance statistics considered profits, losses, and costs. In this sec-
tion, we account for the risks involved in achieving those results.
14.7.1
The Sharpe Ratio
Suppose that a strategy’s excess returns (in excess of the risk-free rate), {rt}t=1,…,T,
are IID Gaussian with mean 𝜇and variance 𝜎2. The Sharpe ratio (SR) is defined as
SR = 𝜇
𝜎
The purpose of SR is to evaluate the skills of a particular strategy or investor.
Since 𝜇, 𝜎are usually unknown, the true SR value cannot be known for certain. The
inevitable consequence is that Sharpe ratio calculations may be the subject of sub-
stantial estimation errors.
14.7.2
The Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio
The probabilistic Sharpe ratio (PSR) provides an adjusted estimate of SR, by remov-
ing the inflationary effect caused by short series with skewed and/or fat-tailed returns.
Given a user-defined benchmark3 Sharpe ratio (SR∗) and an observed Sharpe ratiô SR,
PSR estimates the probability that̂ SR is greater than a hypothetical SR∗. Following
Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012], PSR can be estimated aŝ
PSR [SR∗] = Z

where Z [.] is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard Normal dis-
tribution, T is the number of observed returns,̂ 𝛾3 is the skewness of the returns, and̂
𝛾4 is the kurtosis of the returns (̂𝛾4 = 3 for Gaussian returns). For a given SR∗,̂ PSR
increases with greater̂ SR (in the original sampling frequency, i.e. non-annualized), or
longer track records (T), or positively skewed returns (̂𝛾3), but it decreases with fatter
3 This could be set to a default value of zero (i.e., comparing against no investment skill).

𝛾3 and T.
14.7.3
The Deflated Sharpe Ratio
The deflated Sharpe ratio (DSR) is a PSR where the rejection threshold is adjusted to
reflect the multiplicity of trials. Following Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2014], DSR
can be estimated aŝ PSR [SR∗], where the benchmark Sharpe ratio, SR∗, is no longer
user-defined. Instead, SR∗is estimated as
SR∗=
√
V
[{̂
SRn
}] (
(1 −𝛾) Z−1 [

]
+ 𝛾Z−1 [

where V[{̂SRn}] is the variance across the trials’ estimated SR, N is the number
of independent trials, Z [.] is the CDF of the standard Normal distribution, 𝛾is the
Euler-Mascheroni constant, and n = 1, … , N. Figure 14.3 plots SR∗as a function of
V[{̂SRn}] and N.
The rationale behind DSR is the following: Given a set of SR estimates, {̂SRn},
its expected maximum is greater than zero, even if the true SR is zero. Under the
null hypothesis that the actual Sharpe ratio is zero, H0 : SR = 0, we know that the
expected maximum̂ SR can be estimated as the SR∗. Indeed, SR∗increases quickly
as more independent trials are attempted (N), or the trials involve a greater variance
(V[{̂SRn}]). From this knowledge we derive the third law of backtesting.

Efficiency Statistics
Useful efficiency statistics include:
r Annualized Sharpe ratio: This is the SR value, annualized by a factor
√
a,
where a is the average number of returns observed per year. This common annu-
alization method relies on the assumption that returns are IID.
r Information ratio: This is the SR equivalent of a portfolio that measures its per-
formance relative to a benchmark. It is the annualized ratio between the average
excess return and the tracking error. The excess return is measured as the portfo-
lio’s return in excess of the benchmark’s return. The tracking error is estimated
as the standard deviation of the excess returns.
r Probabilistic Sharpe ratio: PSR corrects SR for inflationary effects caused
by non-Normal returns or track record length. It should exceed 0.95, for the

standard significance level of 5%. It can be computed on absolute or relative
returns.
r Deflated Sharpe ratio: DSR corrects SR for inflationary effects caused by
non-Normal returns, track record length, and multiple testing/selection bias.
It should exceed 0.95, for the standard significance level of 5%. It can be com-
puted on absolute or relative returns.
14.8
CLASSIFICATION SCORES
In the context of meta-labeling strategies (Chapter 3, Section 3.6), it is useful to
understand the performance of the ML overlay algorithm in isolation. Remember that
the primary algorithm identifies opportunities, and the secondary (overlay) algorithm
decides whether to pursue them or pass. A few useful statistics include:
r Accuracy: Accuracy is the fraction of opportunities correctly labeled by the
overlay algorithm,
accuracy =
TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN
where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true negatives,
FP is the number of false positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.
r Precision: Precision is the fraction of true positives among the predicted
positives,
precision =
TP
TP + FP
r Recall: Recall is the fraction of true positives among the positives,
recall =
TP
TP + FN
r F1: Accuracy may not be an adequate classification score for meta-labeling
applications. Suppose that, after you apply meta-labeling, there are many more
negative cases (label ‘0’) than positive cases (label ‘1’). Under that scenario, a
classifier that predicts every case to be negative will achieve high accuracy, even
though recall=0 and precision is undefined. The F1 score corrects for that flaw,
by assessing the classifier in terms of the (equally weighted) harmonic mean of
precision and recall,
F1 = 2 precision ⋅recall
precision + recall
As a side note, consider the unusual scenario where, after applying meta-
labeling, there are many more positive cases than negative cases. A classi-
fier that predicts all cases to be positive will achieve TN=0 and FN=0, hence
accuracy=precision and recall=1. Accuracy will be high, and F1 will not be
smaller than accuracy, even though the classifier is not able to discriminate
between the observed samples. One solution would be to switch the definitions

207
of positive and negative cases, so that negative cases are predominant, and then
score with F1.
r Negative log-loss: Negative log-loss was introduced in Chapter 9, Section 9.4,
in the context of hyper-parameter tuning. Please refer to that section for details.
The key conceptual difference between accuracy and negative log-loss is that
negative log-loss takes into account not only whether our predictions were cor-
rect or not, but the probability of those predictions as well.
See Chapter 3, Section 3.7 for a visual representation of precision, recall, and
accuracy. Table 14.1 characterizes the four degenerate cases of binary classification.
As you can see, the F1 score is not defined in two of those cases. For this reason,
when Scikit-learn is asked to compute F1 on a sample with no observed 1s or with
no predicted 1s, it will print a warning (UndeﬁnedMetricWarning), and set the F1
value to 0.

When all observed values are positive (label ‘1’), there are no true negatives or

(inclusive), and accuracy equals recall. Then, F1 = 2 recall
1+recall ≥recall.

14.9
ATTRIBUTION
The purpose of performance attribution is to decompose the PnL in terms of risk
classes. For example, a corporate bond portfolio manager typically wants to under-
stand how much of its performance comes from his exposure to the following risks
classes: duration, credit, liquidity, economic sector, currency, sovereign, issuer, etc.
Did his duration bets pay off? What credit segments does he excel at? Or should he
focus on his issuer selection skills?
These risks are not orthogonal, so there is always an overlap between them. For
example, highly liquid bonds tend to have short durations and high credit rating, and
are normally issued by large entities with large amounts outstanding, in U.S. dollars.
As a result, the sum of the attributed PnLs will not match the total PnL, but at least we
will be able to compute the Sharpe ratio (or information ratio) per risk class. Perhaps
the most popular example of this approach is Barra’s multi-factor method. See Barra
[1998, 2013] and Zhang and Rachev [2004] for details.

## Page 235

BACKTEST STATISTICS
Of equal interest is to attribute PnL across categories within each class. For exam-
ple, the duration class could be split between short duration (less than 5 years),
medium duration (between 5 and 10 years), and long duration (in excess of 10 years).
This PnL attribution can be accomplished as follows: First, to avoid the overlapping
problem we referred to earlier, we need to make sure that each member of the invest-
ment universe belongs to one and only one category of each risk class at any point in
time. In other words, for each risk class, we split the entire investment universe into
disjoint partitions. Second, for each risk class, we form one index per risk category.
For example, we will compute the performance of an index of short duration bonds,
another index of medium duration bonds, and another index of long duration bonds.
The weightings for each index are the re-scaled weights of our investment portfolio,
so that each index’s weightings add up to one. Third, we repeat the second step, but
this time we form those risk category indices using the weights from the investment
universe (e.g., Markit iBoxx Investment Grade), again re-scaled so that each index’s
weightings add up to one. Fourth, we compute the performance metrics we discussed
earlier in the chapter on each of these indices’ returns and excess returns. For the sake
of clarity, in this context the excess return of a short duration index is the return using
(re-scaled) portfolio weightings (step 2) minus the return using (re-scaled) universe
weightings (step 3).

CHAPTER 15
Understanding Strategy Risk
15.1
MOTIVATION
As we saw in Chapters 3 and 13, investment strategies are often implemented in terms
of positions held until one of two conditions are met: (1) a condition to exit the posi-
tion with profits (profit-taking), or (2) a condition to exit the position with losses (stop-
loss). Even when a strategy does not explicitly declare a stop-loss, there is always
an implicit stop-loss limit, at which the investor can no longer finance her position
(margin call) or bear the pain caused by an increasing unrealized loss. Because most
strategies have (implicitly or explicitly) these two exit conditions, it makes sense to
model the distribution of outcomes through a binomial process. This in turn will help
us understand what combinations of betting frequency, odds, and payouts are uneco-
nomic. The goal of this chapter is to help you evaluate when a strategy is vulnerable
to small changes in any of these variables.
15.2
SYMMETRIC PAYOUTS
Consider a strategy that produces n IID bets per year, where the outcome Xi of a
bet i ∈[1, n] is a profit 𝜋> 0 with probability P[Xi = 𝜋] = p, and a loss −𝜋with
probability P[Xi = −𝜋] = 1 −p. You can think of p as the precision of a binary
classifier where a positive means betting on an opportunity, and a negative means
passing on an opportunity: True positives are rewarded, false positives are pun-
ished, and negatives (whether true or false) have no payout. Since the betting out-
comes {Xi}i=1,…,n are independent, we will compute the expected moments per
bet. The expected profit from one bet is E[Xi] = 𝜋p + (−𝜋)(1 −p) = 𝜋(2p −1). The
variance is V[Xi] = E[X2
i ] −E[Xi]2, where E[X2
i ] = 𝜋2p + (−𝜋)2(1 −p) = 𝜋2, thus
211

UNDERSTANDING STRATEGY RISK
V[Xi] = 𝜋2 −𝜋2(2p −1)2 = 𝜋2[1 −(2p −1)2] = 4𝜋2p(1 −p). For n IID bets per
year, the annualized Sharpe ratio (𝜃) is

Note how 𝜋cancels out of the above equation, because the payouts are symmet-
ric. Just as in the Gaussian case, 𝜃[p, n] can be understood as a re-scaled t-value.
This illustrates the point that, even for a small p > 1
2, the Sharpe ratio can be made
high for a sufficiently large n. This is the economic basis for high-frequency trading,
where p can be barely above .5, and the key to a successful business is to increase
n. The Sharpe ratio is a function of precision rather than accuracy, because passing
on an opportunity (a negative) is not rewarded or punished directly (although too
many negatives may lead to a small n, which will depress the Sharpe ratio toward
zero).
For example, for p = .55,
2p−1

p(1−p) = 0.1005, and achieving an annualized Sharpe
ratio of 2 requires 396 bets per year. Snippet 15.1 verifies this result experimen-
tally. Figure 15.1 plots the Sharpe ratio as a function of precision, for various betting
frequencies.

This equation makes explicit the trade-off between precision (p) and frequency

bets (n = 52) will need a fairly high precision of p = 0.6336 to deliver an annualized
Sharpe of 2.
15.3
ASYMMETRIC PAYOUTS
Consider a strategy that produces n IID bets per year, where the outcome Xi
of a bet i ∈[1, n] is 𝜋+ with probability P[Xi = 𝜋+] = p, and an outcome 𝜋−,
𝜋−< 𝜋+ occurs with probability P[Xi = 𝜋−] = 1 −p. The expected profit from
one bet is E[Xi] = p𝜋+ + (1 −p)𝜋−= (𝜋+ −𝜋−)p + 𝜋−. The variance is V[Xi] =
E[X2
i ] −E[Xi]2, where E[X2
i ] = p𝜋2

The above equation answers the following question: Given a trading rule charac-
terized by parameters {𝜋−, 𝜋+, n}, what is the precision rate p required to achieve a
Sharpe ratio of 𝜃∗? For example, for n = 260, 𝜋−= −.01, 𝜋+ = .005, in order to get
𝜃= 2 we require a p = .72. Thanks to the large number of bets, a very small change
in p (from p = .7 to p = .72) has propelled the Sharpe ratio from 𝜃= 1.173 to 𝜃= 2.
On the other hand, this also tells us that the strategy is vulnerable to small changes in
p. Snippet 15.3 implements the derivation of the implied precision. Figure 15.2 dis-
plays the implied precision as a function of n and 𝜋−, where 𝜋+ = 0.1 and 𝜃∗= 1.5.
As 𝜋−becomes more negative for a given n, a higher p is required to achieve 𝜃∗for
a given 𝜋+. As n becomes smaller for a given 𝜋−, a higher p is required to achieve 𝜃∗
for a given 𝜋+.

THE PROBABILITY OF STRATEGY FAILURE
In the example above, parameters 𝜋−= −.01, 𝜋+ = .005 are set by the portfolio man-
ager, and passed to the traders with the execution orders. Parameter n = 260 is also set
by the portfolio manager, as she decides what constitutes an opportunity worth bet-
ting on. The two parameters that are not under the control of the portfolio manager
are p (determined by the market) and 𝜃∗(the objective set by the investor). Because
p is unknown, we can model it as a random variable, with expected value E [p]. Let
us define p𝜃∗as the value of p below which the strategy will underperform a target
Sharpe ratio 𝜃∗, that is, p𝜃∗= max{p|𝜃≤𝜃∗}. We can use the equations above (or the
binHR function) to conclude that for p𝜃∗=0 = 2
3, p < p𝜃∗=0 ⇒𝜃≤0. This highlights

THE PROBABILITY OF STRATEGY FAILURE

the risks involved in this strategy, because a relatively small drop in p (from p = .7
to p = .67) will wipe out all the profits. The strategy is intrinsically risky, even if the
holdings are not. That is the critical difference we wish to establish with this chapter:
Strategy risk should not be confused with portfolio risk.
Most firms and investors compute, monitor, and report portfolio risk without real-
izing that this tells us nothing about the risk of the strategy itself. Strategy risk is not
the risk of the underlying portfolio, as computed by the chief risk officer. Strategy risk
is the risk that the investment strategy will fail to succeed over time, a question of far
greater relevance to the chief investment officer. The answer to the question “What
is the probability that this strategy will fail?” is equivalent to computing P[p < p𝜃∗].
The following algorithm will help us compute the strategy risk.
15.4.1
Algorithm
In this section we will describe a procedure to compute P[p < p𝜃∗]. Given a time
series of bet outcomes {𝜋t}t=1,…,T, first we estimate 𝜋−= E[{𝜋t|𝜋t ≤0}t=1,…,T], and
𝜋+ = E[{𝜋t|𝜋t > 0}t=1,…,T]. Alternatively, {𝜋−, 𝜋+} could be derived from fitting a
mixture of two Gaussians, using the EF3M algorithm (L´opez de Prado and Foreman
[2014]). Second, the annual frequency n is given by n = T
y , where y is the number of
years elapsed between t = 1 and t = T. Third, we bootstrap the distribution of p as
follows:
1. For iterations i = 1, … , I:
(a) Draw ⌊nk⌋samples from {𝜋t}t=1,…,T with replacement, where k is the num-
ber of years used by investors to assess a strategy (e.g., 2 years). We denote
the set of these drawn samples as {𝜋(i)
j }j=1,…,⌊nk⌋.
(b) Derive
the
observed
precision
from
iteration
i
as
pi =
1
⌊nk⌋‖{𝜋(i)
j |𝜋(i)
j
> 0}j=1,…,⌊nk⌋‖.
2. Fit the PDF of p, denoted f[p], by applying a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE)
on {pi}i=1,…,I.
For a sufficiently large k, we can approximate this third step as f[p] ∼
N[̄p,̄ p(1 −̄ p)], wherē p = E[p] = 1
T ‖{𝜋(i)
t |𝜋(i)
t
> 0}t=1,…,T‖. Fourth, given a thresh-
old 𝜃∗(the Sharpe ratio that separates failure from success), derive p𝜃∗(see Sec-
tion 15.4). Fifth, the strategy risk is computed as P[p < p𝜃∗] = ∫p𝜃∗
−∞f[p]dp.
15.4.2
Implementation
Snippet 15.5 lists one possible implementation of this algorithm. Typically we would
disregard strategies where P[p < p𝜃∗] > .05 as too risky, even if they invest in low
volatility instruments. The reason is that even if they do not lose much money, the
probability that they will fail to achieve their target is too high. In order to be deployed,
the strategy developer must find a way to reduce p𝜃∗.

This approach shares some similarities with PSR (see Chapter 14, and Bailey and
L´opez de Prado [2012, 2014]). PSR derives the probability that the true Sharpe ratio
exceeds a given threshold under non-Gaussian returns. Similarly, the method intro-
duced in this chapter derives the strategy’s probability of failure based on asymmetric
binary outcomes. The key difference is that, while PSR does not distinguish between
parameters under or outside the portfolio manager’s control, the method discussed
here allows the portfolio manager to study the viability of the strategy subject to the
parameters under her control: {𝜋−, 𝜋+, n}. This is useful when designing or assessing
the viability of a trading strategy.

CHAPTER 16
Machine Learning Asset Allocation
16.1
MOTIVATION
This chapter introduces the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) approach.1 HRP portfo-
lios address three major concerns of quadratic optimizers in general and Markowitz’s
Critical Line Algorithm (CLA) in particular: instability, concentration, and under-
performance. HRP applies modern mathematics (graph theory and machine learning
techniques) to build a diversified portfolio based on the information contained in the
covariance matrix. However, unlike quadratic optimizers, HRP does not require the
invertibility of the covariance matrix. In fact, HRP can compute a portfolio on an
ill-degenerated or even a singular covariance matrix, an impossible feat for quadratic
optimizers. Monte Carlo experiments show that HRP delivers lower out-of-sample
variance than CLA, even though minimum-variance is CLA’s optimization objec-
tive. HRP produces less risky portfolios out-of-sample compared to traditional risk
parity methods. Historical analyses have also shown that HRP would have performed
better than standard approaches (Kolanovic et al. [2017], Raffinot [2017]). A practi-
cal application of HRP is to determine allocations across multiple machine learning
(ML) strategies.
16.2
THE PROBLEM WITH CONVEX PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION
Portfolio construction is perhaps the most recurrent financial problem. On a daily
basis, investment managers must build portfolios that incorporate their views and
forecasts on risks and returns. This is the primordial question that 24-year-old Harry
Markowitz attempted to answer more than six decades ago. His monumental insight

MACHINE LEARNING ASSET ALLOCATION
was to recognize that various levels of risk are associated with different optimal
portfolios in terms of risk-adjusted returns, hence the notion of “efficient frontier”
(Markowitz [1952]). One implication is that it is rarely optimal to allocate all assets
to the investments with highest expected returns. Instead, we should take into account
the correlations across alternative investments in order to build a diversified portfolio.
Before earning his PhD in 1954, Markowitz left academia to work for the RAND
Corporation, where he developed the Critical Line Algorithm. CLA is a quadratic
optimization procedure specifically designed for inequality-constrained portfolio
optimization problems. This algorithm is notable in that it guarantees that the exact
solution is found after a known number of iterations, and that it ingeniously circum-
vents the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (Kuhn and Tucker [1951]). A description
and open-source implementation of this algorithm can be found in Bailey and L´opez
de Prado [2013]. Surprisingly, most financial practitioners still seem unaware of CLA,
as they often rely on generic-purpose quadratic programming methods that do not
guarantee the correct solution or a stopping time.
Despite of the brilliance of Markowitz’s theory, a number of practical problems
make CLA solutions somewhat unreliable. A major caveat is that small deviations in
the forecasted returns will cause CLA to produce very different portfolios (Michaud
[1998]). Given that returns can rarely be forecasted with sufficient accuracy, many
authors have opted for dropping them altogether and focusing on the covariance
matrix. This has led to risk-based asset allocation approaches, of which “risk parity” is
a prominent example (Jurczenko [2015]). Dropping the forecasts on returns improves
but does not prevent the instability issues. The reason is that quadratic programming
methods require the inversion of a positive-definite covariance matrix (all eigenvalues
must be positive). This inversion is prone to large errors when the covariance matrix
is numerically ill-conditioned, that is, when it has a high condition number (Bailey
and L´opez de Prado [2012]).
16.3
MARKOWITZ’S CURSE
The condition number of a covariance, correlation (or normal, thus diagonalizable)
matrix is the absolute value of the ratio between its maximal and minimal (by moduli)
eigenvalues. Figure 16.1 plots the sorted eigenvalues of several correlation matrices,
where the condition number is the ratio between the first and last values of each line.
This number is lowest for a diagonal correlation matrix, which is its own inverse.
As we add correlated (multicollinear) investments, the condition number grows. At
some point, the condition number is so high that numerical errors make the inverse
matrix too unstable: A small change on any entry will lead to a very different inverse.
This is Markowitz’s curse: The more correlated the investments, the greater the need
for diversification, and yet the more likely we will receive unstable solutions. The
benefits of diversification often are more than offset by estimation errors.
Increasing the size of the covariance matrix will only make matters worse, as each
covariance coefficient is estimated with fewer degrees of freedom. In general, we need
at least 1
2N(N + 1) independent and identically distributed (IID) observations in order

A diagonal correlation matrix has the lowest condition number. As we add correlated investments, the
maximum eigenvalue is greater and the minimum eigenvalue is lower. The condition number rises quickly,
leading to unstable inverse correlation matrices. At some point, the benefits of diversification are more than
offset by estimation errors.
to estimate a covariance matrix of size N that is not singular. For example, estimating
an invertible covariance matrix of size 50 requires, at the very least, 5 years of daily
IID data. As most investors know, correlation structures do not remain invariant over
such long periods by any reasonable confidence level. The severity of these challenges
is epitomized by the fact that even na¨ıve (equally-weighted) portfolios have been
shown to beat mean-variance and risk-based optimization out-of-sample (De Miguel
et al. [2009]).
16.4
FROM GEOMETRIC TO HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIPS
These instability concerns have received substantial attention in recent years, as
Kolm et al. [2014] have carefully documented. Most alternatives attempt to achieve
robustness by incorporating additional constraints (Clarke et al. [2002]), introducing
Bayesian priors (Black and Litterman [1992]), or improving the numerical stability
of the covariance matrix’s inverse (Ledoit and Wolf [2003]).
All the methods discussed so far, although published in recent years, are derived
from (very) classical areas of mathematics: geometry, linear algebra, and calculus. A
correlation matrix is a linear algebra object that measures the cosines of the angles

MACHINE LEARNING ASSET ALLOCATION
between any two vectors in the vector space formed by the returns series (see Calkin
and L´opez de Prado [2014a, 2015b]). One reason for the instability of quadratic opti-
mizers is that the vector space is modelled as a complete (fully connected) graph,
where every node is a potential candidate to substitute another. In algorithmic terms,
inverting the matrix means evaluating the partial correlations across the complete
graph. Figure 16.2(a) visualizes the relationships implied by a covariance matrix of
50 × 50, that is 50 nodes and 1225 edges. This complex structure magnifies small
estimation errors, leading to incorrect solutions. Intuitively, it would be desirable to
drop unnecessary edges.
Let us consider for a moment the practical implications of such a topological struc-
ture. Suppose that an investor wishes to build a diversified portfolio of securities,
including hundreds of stocks, bonds, hedge funds, real estate, private placements,
etc. Some investments seem closer substitutes of one another, and other investments
seem complementary to one another. For example, stocks could be grouped in terms
of liquidity, size, industry, and region, where stocks within a given group compete
for allocations. In deciding the allocation to a large publicly traded U.S. financial
stock like J. P. Morgan, we will consider adding or reducing the allocation to another
large publicly traded U.S. bank like Goldman Sachs, rather than a small community
bank in Switzerland, or a real estate holding in the Caribbean. Yet, to a correlation
matrix, all investments are potential substitutes to one another. In other words, corre-
lation matrices lack the notion of hierarchy. This lack of hierarchical structure allows
weights to vary freely in unintended ways, which is a root cause of CLA’s instability.
Figure 16.2(b) visualizes a hierarchical structure known as a tree. A tree structure
introduces two desirable features: (1) It has only N −1 edges to connect N nodes,
so the weights only rebalance among peers at various hierarchical levels; and (2) the
weights are distributed top-down, consistent with how many asset managers build
their portfolios (e.g., from asset class to sectors to individual securities). For these
reasons, hierarchical structures are better designed to give not only stable but also
intuitive results.
In this chapter we will study a new portfolio construction method that addresses
CLA’s pitfalls using modern mathematics: graph theory and machine learning. This
Hierarchical Risk Parity method uses the information contained in the covariance
matrix without requiring its inversion or positive-definitiveness. HRP can even com-
pute a portfolio based on a singular covariance matrix. The algorithm operates in
three stages: tree clustering, quasi-diagonalization, and recursive bisection.
16.4.1
Tree Clustering
Consider a TxN matrix of observations X, such as returns series of N variables over T
periods. We would like to combine these N column-vectors into a hierarchical struc-
ture of clusters, so that allocations can flow downstream through a tree graph.
First, we compute an NxN correlation matrix with entries 𝜌= {𝜌i,j}i,j=1,…,N,
where 𝜌i,j = 𝜌[Xi, Xj]. We define the distance measure d : (Xi, Xj) ⊂B →ℝ∈
[0, 1], di,j = d[Xi, Xj] =
√
1
2(1 −𝜌i,j), where B is the Cartesian product of items

Quasi-Diagonalization
This stage reorganizes the rows and columns of the covariance matrix, so that the
largest values lie along the diagonal. This quasi-diagonalization of the covariance
matrix (without requiring a change of basis) renders a useful property: Similar invest-
ments are placed together, and dissimilar investments are placed far apart (see Fig-
ures 16.5 and 16.6 for an example). The algorithm works as follows: We know that
each row of the linkage matrix merges two branches into one. We replace clusters
in (yN−1,1, yN−1,2) with their constituents recursively, until no clusters remain. These
replacements preserve the order of the clustering. The output is a sorted list of original
(unclustered) items. This logic is implemented in Snippet 16.2.

Recursive Bisection
Stage 2 has delivered a quasi-diagonal matrix. The inverse-variance allocation is opti-
mal for a diagonal covariance matrix (see Appendix 16.A.2 for a proof). We can take
advantage of these facts in two different ways: (1) bottom-up, to define the variance of
a contiguous subset as the variance of an inverse-variance allocation; or (2) top-down,
to split allocations between adjacent subsets in inverse proportion to their aggregated
variances. The following algorithm formalizes this idea:
1. The algorithm is initialized by:
(a) setting the list of items: L = {L0}, with L0 = {n}n=1,…,N
(b) assigning a unit weight to all items: wn = 1, ∀n = 1, … , N

takes advantage of the quasi-diagonalization top-down, because it splits the weight
in inverse proportion to the cluster’s variance. This algorithm guarantees that 0 ≤
wi ≤1, ∀i = 1, … , N, and ∑N
i=1 wi = 1, because at each iteration we are splitting the
weights received from higher hierarchical levels. Constraints can be easily introduced
in this stage, by replacing the equations in steps 3c, 3d, and 3e according to the user’s
preferences. Stage 3 is implemented in Snippet 16.3.

cation problem in best-case deterministic logarithmic time, T (n) = (log2 [n]
), and
worst-case deterministic linear time, T (n) = (n). Next, we will put to practice what
we have learned, and evaluate the method’s accuracy out-of-sample.

A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
We begin by simulating a matrix of observations X, of order (10000x10). The cor-
relation matrix is visualized in Figure 16.4 as a heatmap. Figure 16.5 displays the
dendogram of the resulting clusters (stage 1). Figure 16.6 shows the same correlation
matrix, reorganized in blocks according to the identified clusters (stage 2). Appendix
16.A.3 provides the code used to generate this numerical example.
On this random data, we compute HRP’s allocations (stage 3), and compare them
to the allocations from two competing methodologies: (1) Quadratic optimization,
as represented by CLA’s minimum-variance portfolio (the only portfolio of the effi-
cient frontier that does not depend on returns’ means); and (2) traditional risk parity,
exemplified by the Inverse-Variance Portfolio (IVP). See Bailey and L´opez de Prado
[2013] for a comprehensive implementation of CLA, and Appendix 16.A.2 for a

derivation of IVP. We apply the standard constraints that 0 ≤wi ≤1 (non-negativity),
∀i = 1, … , N, and ∑N
i=1 wi = 1 (full investment). Incidentally, the condition number
for the covariance matrix in this example is only 150.9324, not particularly high and
therefore not unfavorable to CLA.
From the allocations in Table 16.1, we can appreciate a few stylized features:
First, CLA concentrates 92.66% of the allocation on the top-5 holdings, while
HRP concentrates only 62.57%. Second, CLA assigns zero weight to 3 investments
(without the 0 ≤wi constraint, the allocation would have been negative). Third,
HRP seems to find a compromise between CLA’s concentrated solution and tra-
ditional risk parity’s IVP allocation. The reader can use the code in Appendix
16.A.3 to verify that these findings generally hold for alternative random covariance
matrices.
What drives CLA’s extreme concentration is its goal of minimizing the portfolio’s
risk. And yet both portfolios have a very similar standard deviation (𝜎HRP = 0.4640,
𝜎CLA = 0.4486). So CLA has discarded half of the investment universe in favor of
a minor risk reduction. The reality of course is that CLA’s portfolio is deceitfully
diversified, because any distress situation affecting the top-5 allocations will have a
much greater negative impact on CLA’s than on HRP’s portfolio.

A characteristic outcome of the three methods studied: CLA concentrates weights on a few investments,
hence becoming exposed to idiosyncratic shocks. IVP evenly spreads weights through all investments,
ignoring the correlation structure. This makes it vulnerable to systemic shocks. HRP finds a compromise
between diversifying across all investments and diversifying across cluster, which makes it more resilient
against both types of shocks.

OUT-OF-SAMPLE MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS
In our numerical example, CLA’s portfolio has lower risk than HRP’s in-sample.
However, the portfolio with minimum variance in-sample is not necessarily the one
with minimum variance out-of-sample. It would be all too easy for us to pick a partic-
ular historical dataset where HRP outperforms CLA and IVP (see Bailey and L´opez
de Prado [2014], and recall our discussion of selection bias in Chapter 11). Instead, in
this section we follow the backtesting paradigm explained in Chapter 13, and evaluate
via Monte Carlo the performance out-of-sample of HRP against CLA’s minimum-
variance and traditional risk parity’s IVP allocations. This will also help us under-
stand what features make a method preferable to the rest, regardless of anecdotal
counter-examples.
First, we generate 10 series of random Gaussian returns (520 observations, equiv-
alent to 2 years of daily history), with 0 mean and an arbitrary standard deviation of
10%. Real prices exhibit frequent jumps (Merton [1976]) and returns are not cross-
sectionally independent, so we must add random shocks and a random correlation
structure to our generated data. Second, we compute HRP, CLA, and IVP portfolios
by looking back at 260 observations (a year of daily history). These portfolios are re-
estimated and rebalanced every 22 observations (equivalent to a monthly frequency).
Third, we compute the out-of-sample returns associated with those three portfolios.
This procedure is repeated 10,000 times.
All mean portfolio returns out-of-sample are essentially 0, as expected. The critical
difference comes from the variance of the out-of-sample portfolio returns: 𝜎2
CLA =
0.1157, 𝜎2
IVP = 0.0928, and 𝜎2
HRP = 0.0671. Although CLA’s goal is to deliver the
lowest variance (that is the objective of its optimization program), its performance
happens to exhibit the highest variance out-of-sample, and 72.47% greater variance
than HRP’s. This experimental finding is consistent with the historical evidence in De
Miguel et al. [2009]. In other words, HRP would improve the out-of-sample Sharpe
ratio of a CLA strategy by about 31.3%, a rather significant boost. Assuming that the
covariance matrix is diagonal brings some stability to the IVP; however, its variance
is still 38.24% greater than HRP’s. This variance reduction out-of-sample is critically
important to risk parity investors, given their use of substantial leverage. See Bailey
et al. [2014] for a broader discussion of in-sample vs. out-of-sample performance.
The mathematical proof for HRP’s outperformance over Markowitz’s CLA and
traditional risk parity’s IVP is somewhat involved and beyond the scope of this chap-
ter. In intuitive terms, we can understand the above empirical results as follows:
Shocks affecting a specific investment penalize CLA’s concentration. Shocks involv-
ing several correlated investments penalize IVP’s ignorance of the correlation struc-
ture. HRP provides better protection against both common and idiosyncratic shocks
by finding a compromise between diversification across all investments and diversifi-
cation across clusters of investments at multiple hierarchical levels. Figure 16.7 plots
the time series of allocations for the first of the 10,000 runs.
Appendix 16.A.4 provides the Python code that implements the above study.
The reader can experiment with different parameter configurations and reach similar
conclusions. In particular, HRP’s out-of-sample outperformance becomes even

(a) Time series of allocations for IVP.
Between the first and second rebalance, one investment receives an idiosyncratic shock, which increases
its variance. IVP’s response is to reduce the allocation to that investment, and spread that former exposure
across all other investments. Between the fifth and sixth rebalance, two investments are affected by a com-
mon shock. IVP’s response is the same. As a result, allocations among the seven unaffected investments
grow over time, regardless of their correlation.
(b) Time series of allocations for HRP
HRP’s response to the idiosyncratic shock is to reduce the allocation to the affected investment, and use that
reduced amount to increase the allocation to a correlated investment that was unaffected. As a response to
the common shock, HRP reduces allocation to the affected investments and increases allocation to uncor-
related ones (with lower variance).
(c) Time series of allocations for CLA
CLA allocations respond erratically to idiosyncratic and common shocks. If we had taken into account
rebalancing costs, CLA’s performance would have been very negative.

FURTHER RESEARCH
The methodology introduced in this chapter is flexible, scalable and admits multiple
variations of the same ideas. Using the code provided, readers can research and eval-
uate what HRP configurations work best for their particular problem. For example, at
stage 1 they can apply alternative definitions of di,j,̃ di,j anḋ di,u, or different clustering
algorithms, like biclustering; at stage 3, they can use different functions for̃ wm and
𝛼, or alternative allocation constraints. Instead of carrying out a recursive bisection,
stage 3 could also split allocations top-down using the clusters from stage 1.
It is relatively straightforward to incorporate forecasted returns, Ledoit-Wolf
shrinkage, and Black-Litterman–style views to this hierarchical approach. In fact,
the inquisitive reader may have realized that, at its core, HRP is essentially a robust
procedure to avoid matrix inversions, and the same ideas underlying HRP can be
used to replace many econometric regression methods, notorious for their unstable
outputs (like VAR or VECM). Figure 16.8 displays (a) a large correlation matrix of
fixed income securities before and (b) after clustering, with over 2.1 million entries.
Traditional optimization or econometric methods fail to recognize the hierarchical
structure of financial Big Data, where the numerical instabilities defeat the benefits
of the analysis, resulting in unreliable and detrimental outcomes.
Kolanovic et al. [2017] conducted a lengthy study of HRP, concluding that “HRP
delivers superior risk-adjusted returns. Whilst both the HRP and the MV portfolios
deliver the highest returns, the HRP portfolios match with volatility targets much
better than MV portfolios. We also run simulation studies to confirm the robustness

of our findings, in which HRP consistently deliver a superior performance over MV
and other risk-based strategies […] HRP portfolios are truly diversified with a higher
number of uncorrelated exposures, and less extreme weights and risk allocations.”
Raffinot [2017] concludes that “empirical results indicate that hierarchical cluster-
ing based portfolios are robust, truly diversified and achieve statistically better risk-
adjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques.”

CONCLUSION
Exact analytical solutions can perform much worse than approximate ML solutions.
Although mathematically correct, quadratic optimizers in general, and Markowitz’s
CLA in particular, are known to deliver generally unreliable solutions due to their
instability, concentration, and underperformance. The root cause for these issues is
that quadratic optimizers require the inversion of a covariance matrix. Markowitz’s
curse is that the more correlated investments are, the greater is the need for a diversi-
fied portfolio, and yet the greater are that portfolio’s estimation errors.
In this chapter, we have exposed a major source of quadratic optimizers’ instabil-
ity: A matrix of size N is associated with a complete graph with 1
2N(N −1) edges.
With so many edges connecting the nodes of the graph, weights are allowed to rebal-
ance with complete freedom. This lack of hierarchical structure means that small
estimation errors will lead to entirely different solutions. HRP replaces the covariance
structure with a tree structure, accomplishing three goals: (1) Unlike traditional risk
parity methods, it fully utilizes the information contained in the covariance matrix,
(2) weights’ stability is recovered and (3) the solution is intuitive by construction.
The algorithm converges in deterministic logarithmic (best case) or linear (worst
case) time.
HRP is robust, visual, and flexible, allowing the user to introduce constraints or
manipulate the tree structure without compromising the algorithm’s search. These
properties are derived from the fact that HRP does not require covariance invertibil-
ity. Indeed, HRP can compute a portfolio on an ill-degenerated or even a singular
covariance matrix.
This chapter focuses on a portfolio construction application; however, the reader
will find other practical uses for making decisions under uncertainty, particularly in
the presence of a nearly singular covariance matrix: capital allocation to portfolio
managers, allocations across algorithmic strategies, bagging and boosting of machine
learning signals, forecasts from random forests, replacement to unstable econometric
models (VAR, VECM), etc.
Of course, quadratic optimizers like CLA produce the minimum-variance port-
folio in-sample (that is its objective function). Monte Carlo experiments show that
HRP delivers lower out-of-sample variance than CLA or traditional risk parity meth-
ods (IVP). Since Bridgewater pioneered risk parity in the 1990s, some of the largest
asset managers have launched funds that follow this approach, for combined assets in
excess of $500 billion. Given their extensive use of leverage, these funds should bene-
fit from adopting a more stable risk parity allocation method, thus achieving superior
risk-adjusted returns and lower rebalance costs.

CORRELATION-BASED METRIC
Consider two real-valued vectors X, Y of size T, and a correlation variable 𝜌[x, y], with
the only requirement that 𝜎[x, y] = 𝜌[x, y]𝜎[X]𝜎[Y], where 𝜎[x, y] is the covariance
between the two vectors, and 𝜎[.] is the standard deviation. Note that Pearson’s is not
the only correlation to satisfy these requirements.
Let us prove that d[x, y] =
√
1
2(1 −𝜌[x, y]) is a true metric. First, the Euclidean
distance between the two vectors is d[x, y] =
√∑T
t=1 (Xt −Yt)2. Second, we z-
standardize those vectors as x = X−̄X
𝜎[X] , y = Y−̄Y
𝜎[Y]. Consequently, 0 ≤𝜌[x, y] = 𝜌[x, y].
Third, we derive the Euclidean distance d[x, y] as,
d[x, y] =

In other words, the distance d[x, y] is a linear multiple of the Euclidean distance
between the vectors {X, Y} after z-standardization, hence it inherits the true-metric
properties of the Euclidean distance.
Similarly, we can prove that d[x, y] =
√
1 −|𝜌[x, y]| descends to a true metric on
the ℤ/2ℤquotient. In order to do that, we redefine y = Y−̄Y

INVERSE VARIANCE ALLOCATION
Stage 3 (see Section 16.4.3) splits a weight in inverse proportion to the subset’s vari-
ance. We now prove that such allocation is optimal when the covariance matrix is
diagonal. Consider the standard quadratic optimization problem of size N,
min

s.t. : 𝜔′a = 1I

REPRODUCING THE NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
Snippet 16.4 can be used to reproduce our results and simulate additional numerical
examples. Function generateData produces a matrix of time series where a number
size0 of vectors are uncorrelated, and a number size1 of vectors are correlated.
The reader can change the np.random.seed in generateData to run alternative
examples and gain an intuition of how HRP works. Scipy’s function linkage can be
used to perform stage 1 (Section 16.4.1), function getQuasiDiag performs stage 2
(Section 16.4.2), and function getRecBipart carries out stage 3 (Section 16.4.3).

REPRODUCING THE MONTE CARLO EXPERIMENT
Snippet 16.5 implements Monte Carlo experiments on three allocation methods:
HRP, CLA, and IVP. All libraries are standard except for HRP, which is provided
in Appendix 16.A.3, and CLA, which can be found in Bailey and L´opez de Prado
[2013]. The subroutine generateData simulates the correlated data, with two types
of random shocks: common to various investments and specific to a single investment.
There are two shocks of each type, one positive and one negative. The variables for
the experiments are set as arguments of hrpMC. They were chosen arbitrarily, and the
user can experiment with alternative combinations.

CHAPTER 17
Structural Breaks
17.1
MOTIVATION
In developing an ML-based investment strategy, we typically wish to bet when there
is a confluence of factors whose predicted outcome offers a favorable risk-adjusted
return. Structural breaks, like the transition from one market regime to another, is
one example of such a confluence that is of particular interest. For instance, a mean-
reverting pattern may give way to a momentum pattern. As this transition takes place,
most market participants are caught off guard, and they will make costly mistakes.
This sort of errors is the basis for many profitable strategies, because the actors on
the losing side will typically become aware of their mistake once it is too late. Before
they accept their losses, they will act irrationally, try to hold the position, and hope
for a comeback. Sometimes they will even increase a losing position, in desperation.
Eventually they will be forced to stop loss or stop out. Structural breaks offer some of
the best risk/rewards. In this chapter, we will review some methods that measure the
likelihood of structural breaks, so that informative features can be built upon them.
17.2
TYPES OF STRUCTURAL BREAK TESTS
We can classify structural break tests in two general categories:
r CUSUM tests: These test whether the cumulative forecasting errors signifi-
cantly deviate from white noise.
r Explosiveness tests: Beyond deviation from white noise, these test whether the
process exhibits exponential growth or collapse, as this is inconsistent with a
random walk or stationary process, and it is unsustainable in the long run.
249

## Page 277

250
STRUCTURAL BREAKS
◦Right-tail unit-root tests: These tests evaluate the presence of exponential
growth or collapse, while assuming an autoregressive specification.
◦Sub/super-martingale tests: These tests evaluate the presence of exponen-
tial growth or collapse under a variety of functional forms.
17.3
CUSUM TESTS
In Chapter 2 we introduced the CUSUM filter, which we applied in the context of
event-based sampling of bars. The idea was to sample a bar whenever some variable,
like cumulative prediction errors, exceeded a predefined threshold. This concept can
be further extended to test for structural breaks.
17.3.1
Brown-Durbin-Evans CUSUM Test on Recursive Residuals
This test was proposed by Brown, Durbin and Evans [1975]. Let us assume that at
every observation t = 1, … , T, we count with an array of features xt predictive of a
value yt. Matrix Xt is composed of the time series of features t ≤T, {xi}i=1,…,t. These
authors propose that we compute recursive least squares (RLS) estimates of 𝛽, based
on the specification
yt = 𝛽
′
t xt + 𝜀t
which is fit on subsamples ([1, k + 1], [1, k + 2], … , [1, T]), giving T −k least squares
estimates (̂𝛽k+1, … ,̂ 𝛽T). We can compute the standardized 1-step ahead recursive
residuals aŝ
𝜔t =
yt −̂ 𝛽
′
t−1xt
√
ft
ft =̂ 𝜎2
𝜀
[
1 + x
′
t
(X

The CUSUM statistic is defined as
St =

j=k+1̂
𝜔ĵ
𝜎𝜔̂
𝜎2
𝜔=
1
T −k
T
∑
t=k
(̂𝜔t −E[̂𝜔t])2
Under the null hypothesis that 𝛽is some constant value, H0 : 𝛽t = 𝛽, then St ∼
N[0, t −k −1]. One caveat of this procedure is that the starting point is chosen arbi-
trarily, and results may be inconsistent due to that.

## Page 278

17.3.2
Chu-Stinchcombe-White CUSUM Test on Levels
This test follows Homm and Breitung [2012]. It simplifies the previous method by
dropping {xt}t=1,…,T, and assuming that H0 : 𝛽t = 0, that is, we forecast no change
(Et−1[Δyt] = 0). This will allow us to work directly with yt levels, hence reducing the
computational burden. We compute the standardized departure of log-price yt relative
to the log-price at yn, t > n, as
Sn,t = (yt −yn)(̂𝜎t
√
t −n)−1̂
𝜎2
t = (t −1)−1
t∑
i=2
(Δyi)2
Under the null hypothesis H0 : 𝛽t = 0, then Sn,t ∼N[0, 1]. The time-dependent
critical value for the one-sided test is
c𝛼[n, t] =
√
b𝛼+ log[t −n]
These authors derived via Monte Carlo that b0.05 = 4.6. One disadvantage of this
method is that the reference level yn is set somewhat arbitrarily. To overcome this
pitfall, we could estimate Sn,t on a series of backward-shifting windows n ∈[1, t],
and pick St = sup
n∈[1,t]
{Sn,t}.
17.4
EXPLOSIVENESS TESTS
Explosiveness tests can be generally divided between those that test for one bubble
and those that test for multiple bubbles. In this context, bubbles are not limited to price
rallies, but they also include sell-offs. Tests that allow for multiple bubbles are more
robust in the sense that a cycle of bubble-burst-bubble will make the series appear to
be stationary to single-bubble tests. Maddala and Kim [1998], and Breitung [2014]
offer good overviews of the literature.
17.4.1
Chow-Type Dickey-Fuller Test
A family of explosiveness tests was inspired by the work of Gregory Chow, starting
with Chow [1960]. Consider the first order autoregressive process
yt = 𝜌yt−1 + 𝜀t
where 𝜀t is white noise. The null hypothesis is that yt follows a random walk, H0:
𝜌= 1, and the alternative hypothesis is that yt starts as a random walk but changes at
time 𝜏∗T, where 𝜏∗∈(0, 1), into an explosive process:
H1 : yt =
{ yt−1 + 𝜀t for t = 1, … , 𝜏∗T
𝜌yt−1 + 𝜀t for t = 𝜏∗T + 1, … , T, with 𝜌> 1

## Page 279

252
STRUCTURAL BREAKS
At time T we can test for a switch (from random walk to explosive process) hav-
ing taken place at time 𝜏∗T (break date). In order to test this hypothesis, we fit the
following specification,
Δyt = 𝛿yt−1Dt[𝜏∗] + 𝜀t
where Dt[𝜏∗] is a dummy variable that takes zero value if t < 𝜏∗T, and takes the value
one if t ≥𝜏∗T. Then, the null hypothesis H0 : 𝛿= 0 is tested against the (one-sided)
alternative H1 : 𝛿> 1:
DFC𝜏∗=̂ 𝛿̂
𝜎𝛿
The main drawback of this method is that 𝜏∗is unknown. To address this issue,
Andrews [1993] proposed a new test where all possible 𝜏∗are tried, within some
interval 𝜏∗∈[𝜏0, 1 −𝜏0]. As Breitung [2014] explains, we should leave out some of
the possible 𝜏∗at the beginning and end of the sample, to ensure that either regime
is fitted with enough observations (there must be enough zeros and enough ones in
Dt[𝜏∗]). The test statistic for an unknown 𝜏∗is the maximum of all T(1 −2𝜏0) values
of DFC𝜏∗.
SDFC =
sup
𝜏∗∈[𝜏0,1−𝜏0]
{DFC𝜏∗}
Another drawback of Chow’s approach is that it assumes that there is only one
break date 𝜏∗T, and that the bubble runs up to the end of the sample (there is no
switch back to a random walk). For situations where three or more regimes (random
walk →bubble →random walk …) exist, we need to discuss the Supremum Aug-
mented Dickey-Fuler (SADF) test.
17.4.2
Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller
In the words of Phillips, Wu and Yu [2011], “standard unit root and cointegration tests
are inappropriate tools for detecting bubble behavior because they cannot effectively
distinguish between a stationary process and a periodically collapsing bubble model.
Patterns of periodically collapsing bubbles in the data look more like data generated
from a unit root or stationary autoregression than a potentially explosive process.” To
address this flaw, these authors propose fitting the regression specification
Δyt = 𝛼+ 𝛽yt−1 +
L
∑
l=1
𝛾lΔyt−l + 𝜀t
where we test for H0 : 𝛽≤0, H1 : 𝛽> 0. Inspired by Andrews [1993], Phillips and
Yu [2011] and Phillips, Wu and Yu [2011] proposed the Supremum Augmented

{ADFt0,t} =

}
wherê 𝛽t0,t is estimated on a sample that starts at t0 and ends at t, 𝜏is the minimum
sample length used in the analysis, t0 is the left bound of the backwards expanding
window, and t = 𝜏, … , T. For the estimation of SADFt, the right side of the window
is fixed at t. The standard ADF test is a special case of SADFt, where 𝜏= t −1.
There are two critical differences between SADFt and SDFC: First, SADFt is com-
puted at each t ∈[𝜏, T], whereas SDFC is computed only at T. Second, instead of
introducing a dummy variable, SADF recursively expands the beginning of the sam-
ple (t0 ∈[1, t −𝜏]). By trying all combinations of a nested double loop on (t0, t),
SADF does not assume a known number of regime switches or break dates. Figure
17.1 displays the series of E-mini S&P 500 futures prices after applying the ETF trick
(Chapter 2, Section 2.4.1), as well as the SADF derived from that price series. The
SADF line spikes when prices exhibit a bubble-like behavior, and returns to low levels
when the bubble bursts. In the following sections, we will discuss some enhancements
to Phillips’ original SADF method.
17.4.2.1
Raw vs. Log Prices
It is common to find in the literature studies that carry out structural break tests on raw
prices. In this section we will explore why log prices should be preferred, particularly
when working with long time series involving bubbles and bursts.

## Page 281

254
STRUCTURAL BREAKS
For raw prices {yt}, if ADF’s null hypotesis is rejected, it means that prices are
stationary, with finite variance. The implication is that returns
yt
yt−1 −1 are not time
invariant, for returns’ volatility must decrease as prices rise and increase as prices
fall in order to keep the price variance constant. When we run ADF on raw prices,
we assume that returns’ variance is not invariant to price levels. If returns variance
happens to be invariant to price levels, the model will be structurally heteroscedastic.
In contrast, if we work with log prices, the ADF specification will state that
Δlog[yt] ∝log[yt−1]
Let us make a change of variable, xt = kyt. Now, log[xt] = log[k] + log[yt], and
the ADF specification will state that
Δlog[xt] ∝log[xt−1] ∝log[yt−1]
Under this alternative specification based on log prices, price levels condition
returns’ mean, not returns’ volatility. The difference may not matter in practice for
small samples, where k ≈1, but SADF runs regressions across decades and bubbles
produce levels that are significantly different between regimes (k ≠1).
17.4.2.2
Computational Complexity
The algorithm runs in (n2), as the number of ADF tests that SADF requires for a
total sample length T is
T
∑
t=𝜏
t −𝜏+ 1 = 1
2(T −𝜏+ 2)(T −𝜏+ 1) =
(T −𝜏+ 2
2
)
Consider a matrix representation of the ADF specification, where X ∈ℝTxN and
y ∈ℝTx1. Solving a single ADF regression involves the floating point operations
(FLOPs) listed in Table 17.1.
This gives a total of f(N, T) = N3 + N2(2T + 3) + N(4T −1) + 2T + 2 FLOPs
per ADF estimate. A single SADF update requires g(N, T, 𝜏) = ∑T
t=𝜏f(N, t) + T −𝜏
FLOPs (T −𝜏operations to find the maximum ADF stat), and the estimation of a full
SADF series requires ∑T
t=𝜏g(N, T, 𝜏).
Consider a dollar bar series on E-mini S&P 500 futures. For (T, N) = (356631,3),
an ADF estimate requires 11,412,245 FLOPs, and a SADF update requires
2,034,979,648,799 operations (roughly 2.035 TFLOPs). A full SADF time series
requires 241,910,974,617,448,672 operations (roughly 242 PFLOPs). This number
will increase quickly, as the T continues to grow. And this estimate excludes noto-
riously expensive operations like alignment, pre-processing of data, I/O jobs, etc.
Needless to say, this algorithm’s double loop requires a large number of operations.
An HPC cluster running an efficiently parallelized implementation of the algorithm
may be needed to estimate the SADF series within a reasonable amount of time.
Chapter 20 will present some parallelization strategies useful in these situations.

Conditions for Exponential Behavior
Consider the zero-lag specification on log prices, Δlog[yt] = 𝛼+ 𝛽log[yt−1] + 𝜀t.
This can be rewritten as log[̃yt] = (1 + 𝛽)log[̃yt−1] + 𝜀t, where log[̃yt] = log[yt] + 𝛼
𝛽.
Rolling back t discrete steps, we obtain E[log[̃yt]] = (1 + 𝛽)tlog[̃y0], or E[log[yt]] =
−𝛼
𝛽+ (1 + 𝛽)t(log[y0] + 𝛼
𝛽). The index t can be reset at a given time, to project the
future trajectory of y0 →yt after the next t steps. This reveals the conditions that
characterize the three states for this dynamic system:
r Steady: 𝛽< 0 ⇒limt→∞E[log[yt]] = −𝛼
𝛽.
◦The disequilibrium is log[yt] −(−𝛼
𝛽) = log[̃yt].
◦Then E[log[̃yt]]
log[̃y0]
= (1 + 𝛽)t = 1
2 at t = −log[2]
log[1+𝛽] (half-life).
r Unit-root: 𝛽= 0, where the system is non-stationary, and behaves as a martin-
gale.
r Explosive: 𝛽> 0, where limt→∞E[log[yt]] =
{
−∞, if log [y0] < 𝛼
𝛽
+∞, if log [y0] > 𝛼
𝛽
.
17.4.2.4
Quantile ADF
SADF takes the supremum of a series on t-values, SADFt = supt0∈[1,t−𝜏]{ADFt0,t}.
Selecting the extreme value introduces some robustness problems, where SADF esti-
mates could vary significantly depending on the sampling frequency and the specific
timestamps of the samples. A more robust estimator of ADF extrema would be the
following: First, let st = {ADFt0,t}t0∈[0,t1−𝜏]. Second, we define Qt,q = Q[st, q] the q
quantile of st, as a measure of centrality of high ADF values, where q ∈[0, 1]. Third,
we definė Qt,q,v = Qt,q+v −Qt,q−v, with 0 < v ≤min{q, 1 −q}, as a measure of dis-
persion of high ADF values. For example, we could set q = 0.95 and v = 0.025. Note

## Page 283

256
STRUCTURAL BREAKS
that SADF is merely a particular case of QADF, where SADFt = Qt,1 anḋ Qt,q,v is not
defined because q = 1.
17.4.2.5
Conditional ADF
Alternatively, we can address concerns on SADF robustness by computing
conditional moments. Let f[x] be the probability distribution function of st =
{ADFt0,t}t0∈[1,t1−𝜏], with x ∈st. Then, we define Ct,q = K−1 ∫∞
Qt,q xf[x]dx as a mea-
sure of centrality of high ADF values, anḋ Ct,q =
√
K−1 ∫∞
Qt,q (x −Ct,q)2f[x]dx as
a measure of dispersion of high ADF values, with regularization constant K =
∫∞
Qt,q f[x]dx. For example, we could use q = 0.95.
By construction, Ct,q ≤SADFt. A scatter plot of SADFt against Ct,q shows that
lower boundary, as an ascending line with approximately unit gradient (see Figure
17.2). When SADF grows beyond −1.5, we can appreciate some horizontal trajec-
tories, consistent with a sudden widening of the right fat tail in st. In other words,
(SADFt −Ct,q)∕̇Ct,q can reach significantly large values even if Ct,q is relatively
small, because SADFt is sensitive to outliers.
Figure 17.3(a) plots (SADFt −Ct,q)∕̇Ct,q for the E-mini S&P 500 futures prices
over time. Figure 17.3(b) is the scatter-plot of (SADFt −Ct,q)∕̇Ct,q against SADFt,
computed on the E-mini S&P 500 futures prices. It shows evidence that outliers in st
bias SADFt upwards.

Implementation of SADF
This section presents an implementation of the SADF algorithm. The purpose of this
code is not to estimate SADF quickly, but to clarify the steps involved in its estima-
tion. Snippet 17.1 lists SADF’s inner loop. That is the part that estimates SADFt =
sup
t0∈[1,t−𝜏]
{̂
𝛽t0,t̂
𝜎𝛽t0,t
}, which is the backshifting component of the algorithm. The outer
loop (not shown here) repeats this calculation for an advancing t, {SADFt}t=1,…,T.
The arguments are:
r logP: a pandas series containing log-prices
r minSL: the minimum sample length (𝜏), used by the final regression
r constant: the regression’s time trend component
◦'nc': no time trend, only a constant
◦'ct': a constant plus a linear time trend
◦'ctt': a constant plus a second-degree polynomial time trend
r lags: the number of lags used in the ADF specification

Sub- and Super-Martingale Tests
In this section we will introduce explosiveness tests that do not rely on the standard
ADF specification. Consider a process that is either a sub- or super-martingale. Given

some observations {yt}, we would like to test for the existence of an explosive time
trend, H0 : 𝛽= 0, H1 : 𝛽≠0, under alternative specifications:
r Polynomial trend (SM-Poly1):
yt = 𝛼+ 𝛾t + 𝛽t2 + 𝜀t
r Polynomial trend (SM-Poly2):
log[yt] = 𝛼+ 𝛾t + 𝛽t2 + 𝜀t
r Exponential trend (SM-Exp):
yt = 𝛼e𝛽t + 𝜀t ⇒log[yt] = log[𝛼] + 𝛽t + 𝜉t
r Power trend (SM-Power):
yt = 𝛼t𝛽+ 𝜀t ⇒log[yt] = log[𝛼] + 𝛽log[t] + 𝜉t
Similar to SADF, we fit any of these specifications to each end point t = 𝜏, … , T,
with backwards expanding start points, then compute
SMTt =
sup
t0∈[1,t−𝜏]
{||̂𝛽t0,t||̂
𝜎𝛽t0,t
}
The reason for the absolute value is that we are equally interested in explosive
growth and collapse. In the simple regression case (Greene [2008], p. 48), the vari-
ance of 𝛽iŝ 𝜎2
𝛽=̂
𝜎2
𝜀̂
𝜎2xx(t−t0), hence limt→∞̂ 𝜎𝛽t0,t = 0. The same result is generalizable
to the multivariate linear regression case (Greene [2008], pp. 51–52). Thê 𝜎2
𝛽of a
weak long-run bubble may be smaller than thê 𝜎2
𝛽of a strong short-run bubble, hence
biasing the method towards long-run bubbles. To correct for this bias, we can penal-
ize large sample lengths by determining the coefficient 𝜑∈[0, 1] that yields best
explosiveness signals.
SMTt =
sup
t0∈[1,t−𝜏]
{
||̂𝛽t0,t||̂
𝜎𝛽t0,t(t −t0)𝜑
}
For instance, when 𝜑= 0.5, we compensate for the lower̂ 𝜎𝛽t0,t associated with
longer sample lengths, in the simple regression case. For 𝜑→0, SMTt will exhibit
longer trends, as that compensation wanes and long-run bubbles mask short-run bub-
bles. For 𝜑→1, SMTt becomes noisier, because more short-run bubbles are selected
over long-run bubbles. Consequently, this is a natural way to adjust the explosiveness

used by the ML algorithm may include SMTt estimated from a wide range of 𝜑values.

CHAPTER 18
Entropy Features
18.1
MOTIVATION
Price series convey information about demand and supply forces. In perfect mar-
kets, prices are unpredictable, because each observation transmits everything that is
known about a product or service. When markets are not perfect, prices are formed
with partial information, and as some agents know more than others, they can exploit
that informational asymmetry. It would be helpful to estimate the informational con-
tent of price series, and form features on which ML algorithms can learn the likely
outcomes. For example, the ML algorithm may find that momentum bets are more
profitable when prices carry little information, and that mean-reversion bets are more
profitable when prices carry a lot of information. In this chapter, we will explore ways
to determine the amount of information contained in a price series.
18.2
SHANNON’S ENTROPY
In this section we will review a few concepts from information theory that will be
useful in the remainder of the chapter. The reader can find a complete exposition in
MacKay [2003]. The father of information theory, Claude Shannon, defined entropy
as the average amount of information (over long messages) produced by a stationary
source of data. It is the smallest number of bits per character required to describe the
message in a uniquely decodable way. Mathematically, Shannon [1948] defined the
entropy of a discrete random variable X with possible values x ∈A as
H[X] ≡−
∑
x∈A
p[x]log2p[x]
263

## Page 291

264
ENTROPY FEATURES
with 0 ≤H[X] ≤log2[‖A‖] where: p[x] is the probability of x; H[X] = 0 ⇔
∃x|p[x] = 1; H[X] = log2[‖A‖] ⇔p[x] =
1
‖A‖ for all x; and ‖A‖ is the size of the
set A. This can be interpreted as the probability weighted average of informational
content in X, where the bits of information are measured as log2
1
p[x]. The rationale for
measuring information as log2
1
p[x] comes from the observation that low-probability
outcomes reveal more information than high-probability outcomes. In other words,
we learn when something unexpected happens. Similarly, redundancy is defined as
R[X] ≡1 −
H[X]
log2[‖A‖]
with 0 ≤R[X] ≤1. Kolmogorov [1965] formalized the connection between redun-
dancy and complexity of a Markov information source. The mutual information
between two variables is defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the joint
probability density to the product of the marginal probability densities.
MI[X, Y] = Ef[x,y]
[
log f[x, y]
f[x]f[y]
]
= H[X] + H[Y] −H[X, Y]
The mutual information (MI) is always non-negative, symmetric, and equals zero
if and only if X and Y are independent. For normally distributed variables, the mutual
information is closely related to the familiar Pearson correlation, 𝜌.
MI[X, Y] = −1
2 log[1 −𝜌2]
Therefore, mutual information is a natural measure of the association between
variables, regardless of whether they are linear or nonlinear in nature (Hausser and
Strimmer [2009]). The normalized variation of information is a metric derived from
mutual information. For several entropy estimators, see:

THE PLUG-IN (OR MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD) ESTIMATOR
In this section we will follow the exposition of entropy’s maximum likelihood esti-
mator in Gao et al. [2008]. The nomenclature may seem a bit peculiar at first (no pun
intended), but once you become familiar with it you will find it convenient. Given a
data sequence xn
1, comprising the string of values starting in position 1 and ending in
position n, we can form a dictionary of all words of length w < n in that sequence,
Aw. Consider an arbitrary word yw
1 ∈Aw of length w. We denotê pw[yw
1 ] the empirical
probability of the word yw
1 in xn
1, which means that̂ pw[yw
1 ] is the frequency with which

## Page 292

LEMPEL-ZIV ESTIMATORS
265
yw
1 appears in xn
1. Assuming that the data is generated by a stationary and ergodic
process, then the law of large numbers guarantees that, for a fixed w and large n, the
empirical distribution̂ pw will be close to the true distribution pw. Under these cir-
cumstances, a natural estimator for the entropy rate (i.e., average entropy per bit) iŝ
Hn,w = −1
w
∑
yw
1 ∈Aŵ
pw
[yw
1
] log2̂pw
[yw
1
]
Since the empirical distribution is also the maximum likelihood estimate of the
true distribution, this is also often referred to as the maximum likelihood entropy
estimator. The value w should be large enough for̂ Hn,w to be acceptably close to the
true entropy H. The value of n needs to be much larger than w, so that the empirical
distribution of order w is close to the true distribution. Snippet 18.1 implements the
plug-in entropy estimator.

LEMPEL-ZIV ESTIMATORS
Entropy can be interpreted as a measure of complexity. A complex sequence con-
tains more information than a regular (predictable) sequence. The Lempel-Ziv (LZ)

## Page 293

ENTROPY FEATURES
algorithm efficiently decomposes a message into non-redundant substrings (Ziv and
Lempel [1978]). We can estimate the compression rate of a message as a function of
the number of items in a Lempel-Ziv dictionary relative to the length of the message.
The intuition here is that complex messages have high entropy, which will require
large dictionaries relative to the length of the string to be transmitted. Snippet 18.2
shows an implementation of the LZ compression algorithm.

msg_=msg[i:j+1]
if msg_ not in lib:
lib.append(msg_)
break
i=j+1
return lib
Kontoyiannis [1998] attempts to make a more efficient use of the information
available in a message. What follows is a faithful summary of the exposition in Gao
et al. [2008]. We will reproduce the steps in that paper, while complementing them
with code snippets that implement their ideas. Let us define Ln
i as 1 plus the length
of the longest match found in the n bits prior to i,
Ln
i = 1 + max{l||xi+l
i
= xj+l
j
for some i −n ≤j ≤i −1, l ∈[0, n]}
Snippet 18.3 implements the algorithm that determines the length of the longest
match. A few notes worth mentioning:
r The value n is constant for a sliding window, and n = i for an expanding
window.
r Computing Ln
i requires data xi+n−1
i−n
. In other words, index i must be at the center
of the window. This is important in order to guarantee that both matching strings
are of the same length. If they are not of the same length, l will have a limited
range and its maximum will be underestimated.
r Some overlap between the two substrings is allowed, although obviously both
cannot start at i.

Ornstein and Weiss [1993] formally established that

log2[n] = 1

Kontoyiannis uses this result to estimate Shannon’s entropy rate. He estimates the
average
Ln
i
log2[n], and uses the reciprocal of that average to estimate H. The general
intuition is, as we increase the available history, we expect that messages with high
entropy will produce relatively shorter non-redundant substrings. In contrast, mes-
sages with low entropy will produce relatively longer non-redundant substrings as
we parse through the message. Given a data realization x∞
−∞, a window length n ≥1,
and a number of matches k ≥1, the sliding-window LZ estimator̂ Hn,k =̂ Hn,k[xn+k−1

expanding window case the length of the message N should be an even number to
ensure that all bits are parsed (recall that xi is at the center, so for an odd-length mes-
sage the last bit would not be read).
The above expressions have been derived under the assumptions of: stationarity,
ergodicity, that the process takes finitely many values, and that the process satisfies
the Doeblin condition. Intuitively, this condition requires that, after a finite number
of steps r, no matter what has occurred before, anything can happen with positive
probability. It turns out that this Doeblin condition can be avoided altogether if we
consider a modified version of the above estimators:̃
Hn,k = 1
k
k
∑
i=1
log2[n]
Ln
ĩ
Hn = 1
n
n
∑
i=2
log2[i]
Li

One practical question when estimating̃ Hn,k is how to determine the window
size n. Gao et al. [2008] argue that k + n = N should be approximately equal to
the message length. Considering that the bias of Ln
i is of order [1/
log2[n]] and
the variance of Ln
i is order [1∕k], the bias/variance trade-off is balanced at around
k ≈[(log2 [n]
)2]. That is, n could be chosen such that N ≈n + (log2 [n]
)2. For
example, for N = 28, a balanced bias/variance window size would be n ≈198, in
which case k ≈58.
Kontoyiannis [1998] proved that̂ H[X] converges to Shannon’s entropy rate with
probability 1 as n approaches infinity. Snippet 18.4 implements the ideas discussed
in Gao et al. [2008], which improve on Kontoyiannis [1997] by looking for the max-
imum redundancy between two substrings of the same size.

One caveat of this method is that entropy rate is defined in the limit. In the words
of Kontoyiannis, “we fix a large integer N as the size of our database.” The theorems
used by Kontoyiannis’ paper prove asymptotic convergence; however, nowhere is a
monotonicity property claimed. When a message is short, a solution may be to repeat
the same message multiple times.
A second caveat is that, because the window for matching must be symmetric
(same length for the dictionary as for the substring being matched), the last bit is
only considered for matching if the message’s length corresponds to an even number.
One solution is to remove the first bit of a message with odd length.
A third caveat is that some final bits will be dismissed when preceded by irreg-
ular sequences. This is also a consequence of the symmetric matching window. For
example, the entropy rate for “10000111” equals the entropy rate for “10000110,”
meaning that the final bit is irrelevant due to the unmatchable “11” in the sixth and
seventh bit. When the end of the message is particularly relevant, a good solution may
be to analyze the entropy of the reversed message. This not only ensures that the final
bits (i.e., the initial ones after the reversing) are used, but actually they will be used
to potentially match every bit. Following the previous example, the entropy rate of
“11100001” is 0.96, while the entropy rate for “01100001’ is 0.84.
18.5
ENCODING SCHEMES
Estimating entropy requires the encoding of a message. In this section we will review
a few encoding schemes used in the literature, which are based on returns. Although

## Page 297

270
ENTROPY FEATURES
not discussed in what follows, it is advisable to encode information from fractionally
(rather than integer) differentiated series (Chapter 4), as they still contain some
memory.
18.5.1
Binary Encoding
Entropy rate estimation requires the discretization of a continuous variable, so that
each value can be assigned a code from a finite alphabet. For example, a stream of
returns rt can be encoded according to the sign, 1 for rt > 0, 0 for rt < 0, removing
cases where rt = 0. Binary encoding arises naturally in the case of returns series sam-
pled from price bars (i.e., bars that contain prices fluctuating between two symmetric
horizontal barriers, centered around the start price), because |rt| is approximately
constant.
When |rt| can adopt a wide range of outcomes, binary encoding discards poten-
tially useful information. That is particularly the case when working with intraday
time bars, which are affected by the heteroscedasticity that results from the inhomo-
geneous nature of tick data. One way to partially address this heteroscedasticity is
to sample prices according to a subordinated stochastic process. Examples of that
are trade bars and volume bars, which contain a fixed number of trades or trades for
a fixed amount of volume (see Chapter 2). By operating in this non-chronological,
market-driven clock, we sample more frequently during highly active periods, and
less frequently during periods of less activity, hence regularizing the distribution of
|rt| and reducing the need for a large alphabet.
18.5.2
Quantile Encoding
Unless price bars are used, it is likely that more than two codes will be needed. One
approach consists in assigning a code to each rt according to the quantile it belongs
to. The quantile boundaries are determined using an in-sample period (training set).
There will be the same number of observations assigned to each letter for the overall
in-sample, and close to the same number of observations per letter out-of-sample.
When using the method, some codes span a greater fraction of rt’s range than others.
This uniform (in-sample) or close to uniform (out-of-sample) distribution of codes
tends to increase entropy readings on average.
18.5.3
Sigma Encoding
As an alternative approach, rather than fixing the number of codes, we could let
the price stream determine the actual dictionary. Suppose we fix a discretization
step, 𝜎. Then, we assign the value 0 to rt ∈[min {r} , min {r} + 𝜎), 1 to rt ∈
[min {r} + 𝜎, min {r} + 2𝜎) and so on until every observation has been encoded with
a total of ceil
[
max{r}−min{r}
𝜎
]
codes, where ceil [.] is the ceiling function. Unlike quan-
tile encoding, now each code covers the same fraction of rt’s range. Because codes
are not uniformly distributed, entropy readings will tend to be smaller than in quantile

encoding on average; however, the appearance of a “rare” code will cause spikes in
entropy readings.
18.6
ENTROPY OF A GAUSSIAN PROCESS
The entropy of an IID Normal random process (see Norwich [2003]) can be
derived as
H = 1
2log[2𝜋e𝜎2]
For the standard Normal, H ≈1.42. There are at least two uses of this result. First,
it allows us to benchmark the performance of an entropy estimator. We can draw
samples from a standard normal distribution, and find what combination of estimator,
message length, and encoding gives us an entropy estimatê H sufficiently close to
the theoretically derived value H. For example, Figure 18.1 plots the bootstrapped
distributions of entropy estimates under 10, 7, 5, and 2 letter encodings, on messages
of length 100, using Kontoyiannis’ method. For alphabets of at least 10 letters, the
algorithm in Snippet 18.4 delivers the correct answer. When alphabets are too small,
information is discarded and entropy is underestimated.
Second, we can use the above equation to connect entropy with volatility, by noting
that 𝜎H = eH−1∕2
√
2𝜋. This gives us an entropy-implied volatility estimate, provided that
returns are indeed drawn from a Normal distribution.
18.7
ENTROPY AND THE GENERALIZED MEAN
Here is an interesting way of thinking about entropy. Consider a set of real numbers
x = {xi}i=1,…,n and weights p = {pi}i=1,…,n, such that 0 ≤pi ≤1, ∀i and ∑n
i=1 pi =
1. The generalized weighted mean of x with weights p on a power q ≠0 is defined as
Mq[x, p] =
( n
∑
i=1
pixq
i
)1∕q
For q < 0, we must require that xi > 0, ∀i. The reason this is a generalized mean
is that other means can be obtained as special cases:
r Minimum: limq→−∞Mq[x, p] = mini{xi}
r Harmonic mean: M−1[x, p] = (∑n
i=1 pix−1
i
)−1
r Geometric mean: limq→0 Mq[x, p] = e
∑n
i=1 pilog[xi] = ∏n
i=1 xipi
r Arithmetic mean: M1[x, {n−1}i=1,…,n] = n−1 ∑n
i=1 xi

Let us define the quantity Nq[p] =

Mq−1[p,p], for some q ≠1. Again, for q < 1 in
Nq[p], we must have pi > 0, ∀i. If pi = 1
k for k ∈[1, n] different indices and pi = 0
elsewhere, then the weight is spread evenly across k different items, and Nq[p] = k
for q > 1. In other words, Nq[p] gives us the effective number or diversity of items in
p, according to some weighting scheme set by q.
Using Jensen’s inequality, we can prove that
𝜕Mq[p,p]
𝜕q
≥0, hence
𝜕Nq[p]
𝜕q
≤0.
Smaller values of q assign a more uniform weight to elements of the partition, giving
relatively more weight to less common elements, and limq→0 Nq[p] is simply the total
number of nonzero pi.
Shannon’s
entropy
is
H[p] = ∑n
i=1 −pilog[pi] = −log[limq→0 Mq[p]] =
log[limq→1 Nq[p]]. This shows that entropy can be interpreted as the logarithm
of the effective number of items in a list p, where q →1. Figure 18.2 illustrates how

A FEW FINANCIAL APPLICATIONS OF ENTROPY

Shannon’s entropy as q approaches 1. Notice, as well, how their behavior stabilizes
as q grows large.
Intuitively, entropy measures information as the level of diversity contained in a
random variable. This intuition is formalized through the notion of generalized mean.
The implication is that Shannon’s entropy is a special case of a diversity measure
(hence its connection with volatility). We can now define and compute alternative
measures of diversity, other than entropy, where q ≠1.
18.8
A FEW FINANCIAL APPLICATIONS OF ENTROPY
In this section we will introduce a few applications of entropy to the modelling of
financial markets.
18.8.1
Market Efficiency
When arbitrage mechanisms exploit the complete set of opportunities, prices instan-
taneously reflect the full amount of available information, becoming unpredictable
(i.e., a martingale), with no discernable patterns. Conversely, when arbitrage is not
perfect, prices contain incomplete amounts of information, which gives rise to pre-
dictable patterns. Patterns occur when a string contains redundant information, which
enables its compression. The entropy rate of a string determines its optimal com-
pression rate. The higher the entropy, the lower the redundancy and the greater the
informational content. Consequently, the entropy of a price string tells us the degree
of market efficiency at a given point in time. A “decompressed” market is an effi-
cient market, because price information is non-redundant. A “compressed” market is
an inefficient market, because price information is redundant. Bubbles are formed in
compressed (low entropy) markets.
18.8.2
Maximum Entropy Generation
In a series of papers, Fiedor [2014a, 2014b, 2014c] proposes to use Kontoyiannis
[1997] to estimate the amount of entropy present in a price series. He argues that,
out of the possible future outcomes, the one that maximizes entropy may be the most
profitable, because it is the one that is least predictable by frequentist statistical mod-
els. It is the black swan scenario most likely to trigger stop losses, thus generating a
feedback mechanism that will reinforce and exacerbate the move, resulting in runs in
the signs of the returns time series.
18.8.3
Portfolio Concentration
Consider an NxN covariance matrix V, computed on returns. First, we compute an
eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix, VW = WΛ. Second, we obtain the factor
loadings vector as f𝜔= W′𝜔, where 𝜔is the vector of allocations, ∑N
n=1 𝜔n = 1.1
1 Alternatively, we could have worked with a vector of holdings, should the covariance matrix had been
computed on price changes.

## Page 303

ENTROPY FEATURES
Third, we derive the portion of risk contributed by each principal component (Bailey
and L´opez de Prado [2012]) as
𝜃i =
[ f𝜔]2
i Λi,i
∑N
n=1[ f𝜔]2
nΛn,n
where ∑N
i=1 𝜃i = 1, and 𝜃i ∈[0, 1], ∀i = 1, … , N. Fourth, Meucci [2009] proposed
the following entropy-inspired definition of portfolio concentration,
H = 1 −1
N e−∑N
n=1 𝜃ilog[𝜃i]
At first, this definition of portfolio concentration may sound striking, because 𝜃i
is not a probability. The connection between this notion of concentration and entropy
is due to the generalized mean, which we discussed in Chapter 18, Section 18.7.
18.8.4
Market Microstructure
Easley et al. [1996, 1997] showed that, when the odds of good news / bad news are
even, the probability of informed trading (PIN) can be derived as
PIN =
𝛼𝜇
𝛼𝜇+ 2𝜀
where 𝜇is the rate of arrival of informed traders, 𝜀is the rate of arrival of uninformed
traders, and 𝛼is the probability of an informational event. PIN can be interpreted as
the fraction of orders that arise from informed traders relative to the overall order
flow.
Within a volume bar of size V, we can classify ticks as buy or sell according to
some algorithm, such as the tick rule or the Lee-Ready algorithm. Let VB
𝜏be the
sum of the volumes from buy ticks included in volume bar 𝜏, and VS
𝜏the sum of the
volumes from sell ticks within volume bar 𝜏. Easley et al. [2012a, 2012b] note that
E[|VB
𝜏−VS
𝜏|] ≈𝛼𝜇and that the expected total volume is E[VB
𝜏+ VS
𝜏] = 𝛼𝜇+ 2𝜀. By
using a volume clock (Easley et al. [2012c]), we can set the value of E[VB
𝜏+ VS
𝜏] =
𝛼𝜇+ 2𝜀= V exogenously. This means that, under a volume clock, PIN reduces to
VPIN =
𝛼𝜇
𝛼𝜇+ 2𝜀= 𝛼𝜇
V ≈1
V E[||2VB
𝜏−V||
] = E[||2vB
𝜏−1||
]
where vB
𝜏=
VB
𝜏
V . Note that 2vB
𝜏−1 represents the order flow imbalance, OI𝜏, which is
a bounded real-valued variable, where OI𝜏∈[−1, 1]. The VPIN theory thus provides
a formal link between the probability of informed trading (PIN) and the persistency
of order flow imbalances under a volume clock. See Chapter 19 for further details on
this microstructural theory.

## Page 304

EXERCISES
277
Persistent order flow imbalance is a necessary, non-sufficient condition for adverse
selection. For market makers to provide liquidity to informed traders, that order flow
imbalance |OI𝜏| must also have been relatively unpredictable. In other words, market
makers are not adversely selected when their prediction of order flow imbalance is
accurate, even if |OI𝜏| ≫0. In order to determine the probability of adverse selection,
we must determine how unpredictable the order flow imbalance is. We can determine
this by applying information theory.
Consider a long sequence of symbols. When that sequence contains few redundant
patterns, it encompasses a level of complexity that makes it hard to describe and pre-
dict. Kolmogorov [1965] formulated this connection between redundancy and com-
plexity. In information theory, lossless compression is the task of perfectly describing
a sequence with as few bits as possible. The more redundancies a sequence contains,
the greater compression rates can be achieved. Entropy characterizes the redundancy
of a source, hence its Kolmogorov complexity and its predictability. We can use this
connection between the redundancy of a sequence and its unpredictability (by market
makers) to derive the probability of adverse selection.
Here we will discuss one particular procedure that derives the probability of
adverse selection as a function of the complexity ingrained in the order flow imbal-
ance. First, given a sequence of volume bars indexed by 𝜏= 1, … , N, each bar
of size V, we determine the portion of volume classified as buy, vB
𝜏∈[0, 1]. Sec-
ond, we compute the q-quantiles on {vB
𝜏} that define a set K of q disjoint subsets,
K = {K1, … , Kq}. Third, we produce a mapping from each vB
𝜏to one of the dis-
joint subsets, f : vB
𝜏→{1, … , q}, where f[vB
𝜏] = i ⇔vB
𝜏∈Ki, ∀i ∈[1, q]. Fourth, we
quantize {vB
𝜏} by assigning to each value vB
𝜏the index of the subset K it belongs to,
f[vB
𝜏]. This results in a translation of the set of order imbalances {vB
𝜏} into a quan-
tized message X = [f[vB
1], f[vB
2], … , f[vB
N]]. Fifth, we estimate the entropy H[X] using
Kontoyiannis’ Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Sixth, we derive the cumulative distribution
function, F[H[X]], and use the time series of {F[H[X𝜏]]}𝜏=1,…,N as a feature to pre-
dict adverse selection.

CHAPTER 19
Microstructural Features
19.1
MOTIVATION
Market microstructure studies “the process and outcomes of exchanging assets under
explicit trading rules” (O’Hara [1995]). Microstructural datasets include primary
information about the auctioning process, like order cancellations, double auction
book, queues, partial fills, aggressor side, corrections, replacements, etc. The main
source is Financial Information eXchange (FIX) messages, which can be purchased
from exchanges. The level of detail contained in FIX messages provides researchers
with the ability to understand how market participants conceal and reveal their inten-
tions. That makes microstructural data one of the most important ingredients for
building predictive ML features.
19.2
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
The depth and complexity of market microstructure theories has evolved over time,
as a function of the amount and variety of the data available. The first generation of
models used solely price information. The two foundational results from those early
days are trade classification models (like the tick rule) and the Roll [1984] model. The
second generation of models came after volume datasets started to become available,
and researchers shifted their attention to study the impact that volume has on prices.
Two examples for this generation of models are Kyle [1985] and Amihud [2002].
The third generation of models came after 1996, when Maureen O’Hara, David
Easley, and others published their “probability of informed trading” (PIN) theory
(Easley et al. [1996]). This constituted a major breakthrough, because PIN explained
the bid-ask spread as the consequence of a sequential strategic decision between liq-
uidity providers (market makers) and position takers (informed traders). Essentially,
it illustrated that market makers were sellers of the option to be adversely selected by
281

## Page 309

282
MICROSTRUCTURAL FEATURES
informed traders, and the bid-ask spread is the premium they charge for that option.
Easley et al. [2012a, 2012b] explain how to estimate VPIN, a high-frequency estimate
of PIN under volume-based sampling.
These are the main theoretical frameworks used by the microstructural literature.
O’Hara [1995] and Hasbrouck [2007] offer a good compendium of low-frequency
microstructural models. Easley et al. [2013] present a modern treatment of high-
frequency microstructural models.
19.3
FIRST GENERATION: PRICE SEQUENCES
The first generation of microstructural models concerned themselves with estimating
the bid-ask spread and volatility as proxies for illiquidity. They did so with limited
data and without imposing a strategic or sequential structure to the trading process.
19.3.1
The Tick Rule
In a double auction book, quotes are placed for selling a security at various price levels
(offers) or for buying a security at various price levels (bids). Offer prices always
exceed bid prices, because otherwise there would be an instant match. A trade occurs
whenever a buyer matches an offer, or a seller matches a bid. Every trade has a buyer
and a seller, but only one side initiates the trade.
The tick rule is an algorithm used to determine a trade’s aggressor side. A buy-
initiated trade is labeled “1”, and a sell-initiated trade is labeled “-1”, according to
this logic:
bt =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
1
if Δpt > 0
−1
if Δpt < 0
bt−1
if Δpt = 0
where pt is the price of the trade indexed by t = 1, …, T, and b0 is arbitrarily set to
1. A number of studies have determined that the tick rule achieves high classifica-
tion accuracy, despite its relative simplicity (Aitken and Frino [1996]). Competing
classification methods include Lee and Ready [1991] and Easley et al. [2016].
Transformations of the {bt} series can result in informative features. Such trans-
formations include: (1) Kalman Filters on its future expected value, Et[bt+1]; (2)
structural breaks on such predictions (Chapter 17), (3) entropy of the {bt} sequence
(Chapter 18); (4) t-values from Wald-Wolfowitz’s tests of runs on {bt}; (5) fractional
differentiation of the cumulative {bt} series, ∑t
i=1 bi (Chapter 5); etc.
19.3.2
The Roll Model
Roll [1984] was one of the first models to propose an explanation for the effective
bid-ask spread at which a security trades. This is useful in that bid-ask spreads are a
function of liquidity, hence Roll’s model can be seen as an early attempt to measure

## Page 310

FIRST GENERATION: PRICE SEQUENCES
283
the liquidity of a security. Consider a mid-price series {mt}, where prices follow a
Random Walk with no drift,
mt = mt−1 + ut
hence price changes Δmt = mt −mt−1 are independently and identically drawn from
a Normal distribution
Δmt∼N [0, 𝜎2
u
]
These assumptions are, of course, against all empirical observations, which sug-
gest that financial time series have a drift, they are heteroscedastic, exhibit serial
dependency, and their returns distribution is non-Normal. But with a proper sampling
procedure, as we saw in Chapter 2, these assumptions may not be too unrealistic. The
observed prices, {pt}, are the result of sequential trading against the bid-ask spread:
pt = mt + btc
where c is half the bid-ask spread, and bt ∈{−1, 1} is the aggressor side. The Roll
model assumes that buys and sells are equally likely, P[bt = 1] = P[bt = −1] = 1
2,
serially independent, E[btbt−1] = 0, and independent from the noise, E[btut] = 0.
Given these assumptions, Roll derives the values of c and 𝜎2
u as follows:
𝜎2 [Δpt
] = E
[(Δpt
)2]
−(E [(Δpt
)])2 = 2c2 + 𝜎2
u
𝜎[Δpt, Δpt−1
] = −c2
resulting in c =
√
max{0, −𝜎[Δpt, Δpt−1]} and 𝜎2
u = 𝜎2[Δpt] + 2𝜎[Δpt, Δpt−1]. In
conclusion, the bid-ask spread is a function of the serial covariance of price changes,
and the true (unobserved) price’s noise, excluding microstructural noise, is a function
of the observed noise and the serial covariance of price changes.
The reader may question the need for Roll’s model nowadays, when datasets
include bid-ask prices at multiple book levels. One reason the Roll model is still
in use, despite its limitations, is that it offers a relatively direct way to determine the
effective bid-ask spread of securities that are either rarely traded, or where the pub-
lished quotes are not representative of the levels at which market makers’ are willing
to provide liquidity (e.g., corporate, municipal, and agency bonds). Using Roll’s esti-
mates, we can derive informative features regarding the market’s liquidity conditions.
19.3.3
High-Low Volatility Estimator
Beckers [1983] shows that volatility estimators based on high-low prices are more
accurate than the standard estimators of volatility based on closing prices. Parkinson

𝜋, Ht is the high price for bar t, and Lt is the low price
for bar t. Then the volatility feature 𝜎HL can be robustly estimated based on observed
high-low prices.
19.3.4
Corwin and Schultz
Building on the work of Beckers [1983], Corwin and Schultz [2012] introduce a bid-
ask spread estimator from high and low prices. The estimator is based on two prin-
ciples: First, high prices are almost always matched against the offer, and low prices
are almost always matched against the bid. The ratio of high-to-low prices reflects
fundamental volatility as well as the bid-ask spread. Second, the component of the
high-to-low price ratio that is due to volatility increases proportionately with the time
elapsed between two observations.
Corwin and Schultz show that the spread, as a percentage of price, can be estimated
as
St = 2 (e𝛼t −1)
1 + e𝛼t
where

and Ht−1,t is the high price over 2 bars (t −1 and t), whereas Lt−1,t is the low price over
2 bars (t −1 and t). Because 𝛼t < 0 ⇒St < 0, the authors recommend setting negative

algorithm. The corwinSchultz function receives two arguments, a series dataframe
with columns (High,Low), and an integer value sl that defines the sample length used
to estimate 𝛽t.

Note that volatility does not appear in the final Corwin-Schultz equations. The
reason is that volatility has been replaced by its high/low estimator. As a byproduct
of this model, we can derive the Becker-Parkinson volatility as shown in Snippet 19.2.

This procedure is particularly helpful in the corporate bond market, where there
is no centralized order book, and trades occur through bids wanted in competition
(BWIC). The resulting feature, bid-ask spread S, can be estimated recursively over a
rolling window, and values can be smoothed using a Kalman filter.
19.4
SECOND GENERATION: STRATEGIC TRADE MODELS
Second generation microstructural models focus on understanding and measuring
illiquidity. Illiquidity is an important informative feature in financial ML models,
because it is a risk that has an associated premium. These models have a stronger
theoretical foundation than first-generation models, in that they explain trading as
the strategic interaction between informed and uninformed traders. In doing so, they
pay attention to signed volume and order flow imbalance.
Most of these features are estimated through regressions. In practice, I have
observed that the t-values associated with these microstructural estimates are more
informative than the (mean) estimates themselves. Although the literature does not
mention this observation, there is a good argument for preferring features based on
t-values over features based on mean values: t-values are re-scaled by the standard
deviation of the estimation error, which incorporates another dimension of informa-
tion absent in mean estimates.
19.4.1
Kyle’s Lambda
Kyle [1985] introduced the following strategic trade model. Consider a risky asset
with terminal value v ∼N[p0, Σ0], as well as two traders:
r A noise trader who trades a quantity u = N[0, 𝜎2
u], independent of v.
r An informed trader who knows v and demands a quantity x, through a market
order.
The market maker observes the total order flow y = x + u, and sets a price p accord-
ingly. In this model, market makers cannot distinguish between orders from noise

## Page 314

SECOND GENERATION: STRATEGIC TRADE MODELS
287
traders and informed traders. They adjust prices as a function of the order flow imbal-
ance, as that may indicate the presence of an informed trader. Hence, there is a positive
relationship between price change and order flow imbalance, which is called market
impact.
The informed trader conjectures that the market maker has a linear price adjust-
ment function, p = 𝜆y + 𝜇, where 𝜆is an inverse measure of liquidity. The informed
trader’s profits are 𝜋= (v −p)x, which are maximized at x = v−𝜇
2𝜆, with second order
condition 𝜆> 0.
Conversely, the market maker conjectures that the informed trader’s demand is a
linear function of v: x = 𝛼+ 𝛽v, which implies 𝛼= −𝜇
2𝜆and 𝛽=
1
2𝜆. Note that lower
liquidity means higher 𝜆, which means lower demand from the informed trader.
Kyle argues that the market maker must find an equilibrium between profit max-
imization and market efficiency, and that under the above linear functions, the only
possible solution occurs when
𝜇= p0
𝛼= p0

The implication is that the informed trader has three sources of profit:
r The security’s mispricing.
r The variance of the noise trader’s net order flow. The higher the noise, the easier
the informed trader can conceal his intentions.
r The reciprocal of the terminal security’s variance. The lower the volatility, the
easier to monetize the mispricing.

In Kyle’s model, the variable 𝜆captures price impact. Illiquidity increases with
uncertainty about v and decreases with the amount of noise. As a feature, it can be
estimated by fitting the regression
Δpt = 𝜆(btVt
) + 𝜀t
where {pt} is the time series of prices, {bt} is the time series of aggressor flags, {Vt} is
the time series of traded volumes, and hence {btVt} is the time series of signed volume
or net order flow. Figure 19.1 plots the histogram of Kyle’s lambdas estimated on the

Amihud’s Lambda
Amihud [2002] studies the positive relationship between absolute returns and illiq-
uidity. In particular, he computes the daily price response associated with one dollar
of trading volume, and argues its value is a proxy of price impact. One possible imple-
mentation of this idea is
|||Δlog [̃p𝜏
]||| = 𝜆
∑
t∈B𝜏
(ptVt
) + 𝜀𝜏
where B𝜏is the set of trades included in bar 𝜏,̃ p𝜏is the closing price of bar 𝜏, and
ptVt is the dollar volume involved in trade t ∈B𝜏. Despite its apparent simplicity,
Hasbrouck [2009] found that daily Amihud’s lambda estimates exhibit a high rank

19.4.3
Hasbrouck’s Lambda
Hasbrouck [2009] follows up on Kyle’s and Amihud’s ideas, and applies them to
estimating the price impact coefficient based on trade-and-quote (TAQ) data. He uses
a Gibbs sampler to produce a Bayesian estimation of the regression specification

∑
t∈Bi,𝜏

where Bi,𝜏is the set of trades included in bar 𝜏for security i, with i = 1, …, I,̃ pi,𝜏is
the closing price of bar 𝜏for security i, bi,t ∈{−1, 1} indicates whether trade t ∈Bi,𝜏
was buy-initiated or sell-initiated; and pi,tVi,t is the dollar volume involved in trade
t ∈Bi,𝜏. We can then estimate 𝜆i for every security i, and use it as a feature that
approximates the effective cost of trading (market impact).
Consistent with most of the literature, Hasbrouck recommends 5-minute time-bars
for sampling ticks. However, for the reasons discussed in Chapter 2, better results can
be achieved through stochastic sampling methods that are synchronized with market
activity. Figure 19.3 plots the histogram of Hasbrouck’s lambdas estimated on the
E-mini S&P 500 futures series.

THIRD GENERATION: SEQUENTIAL TRADE MODELS
As we have seen in the previous section, strategic trade models feature a single
informed trader who can trade at multiple times. In this section we will discuss
an alternative kind of model, where randomly selected traders arrive at the market
sequentially and independently.
Since their appearance, sequential trade models have become very popular among
market makers. One reason is, they incorporate the sources of uncertainty faced by
liquidity providers, namely the probability that an informational event has taken
place, the probability that such event is negative, the arrival rate of noise traders,
and the arrival rate of informed traders. With those variables, market makers must
update quotes dynamically, and manage their inventories.
19.5.1
Probability of Information-based Trading
Easley et al. [1996] use trade data to determine the probability of information-based
trading (PIN) of individual securities. This microstructure model views trading as
a game between market makers and position takers that is repeated over multiple
trading periods.
Denote a security’s price as S, with present value S0. However, once a certain
amount of new information has been incorporated into the price, S will be either SB
(bad news) or SG (good news). There is a probability 𝛼that new information will
arrive within the timeframe of the analysis, a probability 𝛿that the news will be bad,

## Page 318

THIRD GENERATION: SEQUENTIAL TRADE MODELS
291
and a probability (1 −𝛿) that the news will be good. These authors prove that the
expected value of the security’s price can then be computed at time t as
E [St
] = (1 −𝛼t
) S0 + 𝛼t
[𝛿tSB + (1 −𝛿t
) SG
]
Following a Poisson distribution, informed traders arrive at a rate 𝜇, and unin-
formed traders arrive at a rate 𝜀. Then, in order to avoid losses from informed traders,
market makers reach breakeven at a bid level Bt,
E [Bt
] = E [St
] −
𝜇𝛼t𝛿t
𝜀+ 𝜇𝛼t𝛿t
(E [St
] −SB
)
and the breakeven ask level At at time t must be,
E [At
] = E [St
] +
𝜇𝛼t
(1 −𝛿t
)
𝜀+ 𝜇𝛼t
(1 −𝛿t
)
(SG −E [St
])
It follows that the breakeven bid-ask spread is determined as
E [At −Bt
] =
𝜇𝛼t
(1 −𝛿t
)
𝜀+ 𝜇𝛼t
(1 −𝛿t
)
(SG −E [St
]) +
𝜇𝛼t𝛿t
𝜀+ 𝜇𝛼t𝛿t
(E [St
] −SB
)
For the standard case when 𝛿t = 1
2, we obtain
𝛿t = 1
2 ⇒E [At −Bt
] =
𝛼t𝜇
𝛼t𝜇+ 2𝜀
(SG −SB
)
This equation tells us that the critical factor that determines the price range at
which market makers provide liquidity is
PINt =
𝛼t𝜇
𝛼t𝜇+ 2𝜀
The subscript t indicates that the probabilities 𝛼and 𝛿are estimated at that point
in time. The authors apply a Bayesian updating process to incorporate information
after each trade arrives to the market.
In order to determine the value PINt, we must estimate four non-observable param-
eters, namely {𝛼, 𝛿, 𝜇, 𝜀}. A maximum-likelihood approach is to fit a mixture of three
Poisson distributions,
P[VB, VS] = (1 −𝛼)P[VB, 𝜀]P[VS, 𝜀]
+ 𝛼(𝛿P[VB, 𝜀]P[VS, 𝜇+ 𝜀] + (1 −𝛿)P[VB, 𝜇+ 𝜀]P[VS, 𝜀])

## Page 319

292
MICROSTRUCTURAL FEATURES
where VB is the volume traded against the ask (buy-initiated trades), and VS is the
volume traded against the bid (sell-initiated trades).
19.5.2
Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading
Easley et al. [2008] proved that
E [VB −VS] = (1 −𝛼) (𝜀−𝜀) + 𝛼(1 −𝛿) (𝜀−(𝜇+ 𝜀)) + 𝛼𝛿(𝜇+ 𝜀−𝜀)
= 𝛼𝜇(1 −2𝛿)
and in particular, for a sufficiently large 𝜇,
E[|VB −VS|] ≈𝛼𝜇
Easley et al. [2011] proposed a high-frequency estimate of PIN, which they named
volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (VPIN). This procedure adopts
a volume clock, which synchronizes the data sampling with market activity, as cap-
tured by volume (see Chapter 2). We can then estimate
1
n
n
∑
𝜏=1
|||VB

where VB
𝜏is the sum of volumes from buy-initiated trades within volume bar 𝜏, VS
𝜏is
the sum of volumes from sell-initiated trades within volume bar 𝜏, and n is the number
of bars used to produce this estimate. Because all volume bars are of the same size,
V, we know that by construction
1
n
n
∑
𝜏=1
(VB
𝜏+ VS

Hence, PIN can be estimated in high-frequency as

𝜏=1
(VB

For additional details and case studies of VPIN, see Easley et al. [2013]. Using
linear regressions, Andersen and Bondarenko [2013] concluded that VPIN is not a
good predictor of volatility. However, a number of studies have found that VPIN
indeed has predictive power: Abad and Yague [2012], Bethel et al. [2012], Cheung
et al. [2015], Kim et al. [2014], Song et al. [2014], Van Ness et al. [2017], and Wei
et al. [2013], to cite a few. In any case, linear regression is a technique that was already
known to 18th-century mathematicians (Stigler [1981]), and economists should not
be surprised when it fails to recognize complex non-linear patterns in 21st-century
financial markets.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES FROM MICROSTRUCTURAL
DATASETS
The features we have studied in Sections 19.3 to 19.5 were suggested by mar-
ket microstructure theory. In addition, we should consider alternative features that,
although not suggested by the theory, we suspect carry important information about
the way market participants operate, and their future intentions. In doing so, we will
harness the power of ML algorithms, which can learn how to use these features with-
out being specifically directed by theory.
19.6.1
Distibution of Order Sizes
Easley et al. [2016] study the frequency of trades per trade size, and find that
trades with round sizes are abnormally frequent. For example, the frequency rates
quickly decay as a function of trade size, with the exception of round trade sizes
{5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, …}. These authors attribute this phenomenon to so-
called “mouse” or “GUI” traders, that is, human traders who send orders by clicking
buttons on a GUI (Graphical User Interface). In the case of the E-mini S&P 500, for
example, size 10 is 2.9 times more frequent than size 9; size 50 is 10.9 times more
likely than size 49; size 100 is 16.8 times more frequent than size 99; size 200 is 27.2
times more likely than size 199; size 250 is 32.5 times more frequent than size 249;
size 500 is 57.1 times more frequent than size 499. Such patterns are not typical of
“silicon traders,” who usually are programmed to randomize trades to disguise their
footprint in markets.
A useful feature may be to determine the normal frequency of round-sized trades,
and monitor deviations from that expected value. The ML algorithm could, for exam-
ple, determine if a larger-than-usual proportion of round-sized trades is associated
with trends, as human traders tend to bet with a fundamental view, belief, or convic-
tion. Conversely, a lower-than-usual proportion of round-sized trades may increase
the likelihood that prices will move sideways, as silicon traders do not typically hold
long-term views.
19.6.2
Cancellation Rates, Limit Orders, Market Orders
Eisler et al. [2012] study the impact of market orders, limit orders, and quote can-
cellations. These authors find that small stocks respond differently than large stocks
to these events. They conclude that measuring these magnitudes is relevant to model
the dynamics of the bid-ask spread.
Easley et al. [2012] also argue that large quote cancellation rates may be indicative
of low liquidity, as participants are publishing quotes that do not intend to get filled.
They discuss four categories of predatory algorithms:
r Quote stuffers: They engage in “latency arbitrage.” Their strategy involves
overwhelming an exchange with messages, with the sole intention of slowing
down competing algorithms, which are forced to parse messages that only the
originators know can be ignored.

MICROSTRUCTURAL FEATURES
r Quote danglers: This strategy sends quotes that force a squeezed trader to
chase a price against her interests. O’Hara [2011] presents evidence of their
disruptive activities.
r Liquidity squeezers: When a distressed large investor is forced to unwind her
position, predatory algorithms trade in the same direction, draining as much
liquidity as possible. As a result, prices overshoot and they make a profit (Carlin
et al. [2007]).
r Pack hunters: Predators hunting independently become aware of one another’s
activities, and form a pack in order to maximize the chances of triggering a cas-
cading effect (Donefer [2010], Fabozzi et al. [2011], Jarrow and Protter [2011]).
NANEX [2011] shows what appears to be pack hunters forcing a stop loss.
Although their individual actions are too small to raise the regulator’s suspi-
cion, their collective action may be market-manipulative. When that is the case,
it is very hard to prove their collusion, since they coordinate in a decentralized,
spontaneous manner.
These predatory algorithms utilize quote cancellations and various order types in
an attempt to adversely select market makers. They leave different signatures in the
trading record, and measuring the rates of quote cancellation, limit orders, and market
orders can be the basis for useful features, informative of their intentions.
19.6.3
Time-Weighted Average Price Execution Algorithms
Easley et al. [2012] demonstrate how to recognize the presence of execution algo-
rithms that target a particular time-weighted average price (TWAP). A TWAP algo-
rithm is an algorithm that slices a large order into small ones, which are submitted
at regular time intervals, in an attempt to achieve a pre-defined time-weighted aver-
age price. These authors take a sample of E-mini S&P 500 futures trades between
November 7, 2010, and November 7, 2011. They divide the day into 24 hours, and
for every hour, they add the volume traded at each second, irrespective of the minute.
Then they plot these aggregate volumes as a surface where the x-axis is assigned
to volume per second, the y-axis is assigned to hour of the day, and the z-axis is
assigned to the aggregate volume. This analysis allows us to see the distribution of
volume within each minute as the day passes, and search for low-frequency traders
executing their massive orders on a chronological time-space. The largest concentra-
tions of volume within a minute tend to occur during the first few seconds, for almost
every hour of the day. This is particularly true at 00:00–01:00 GMT (around the open
of Asian markets), 05:00–09:00 GMT (around the open of U.K. and European equi-
ties), 13:00–15:00 GMT (around the open of U.S. equities), and 20:00–21:00 GMT
(around the close of U.S. equities).
A useful ML feature may be to evaluate the order imbalance at the beginning of
every minute, and determine whether there is a persistent component. This can then be
used to front-run large institutional investors, while the larger portion of their TWAP
order is still pending.

WHAT IS MICROSTRUCTURAL INFORMATION?
295
19.6.4
Options Markets
Muravyev et al. [2013] use microstructural information from U.S. stocks and
options to study events where the two markets disagree. They characterize such
disagreement by deriving the underlying bid-ask range implied by the put-call parity
quotes and comparing it to the actual bid-ask range of the stock. They conclude that
disagreements tend to be resolved in favor of stock quotes, meaning that option quotes
do not contain economically significant information. At the same time, they do find
that option trades contain information not included in the stock price. These findings
will not come as a surprise to portfolio managers used to trade relatively illiquid prod-
ucts, including stock options. Quotes can remain irrational for prolonged periods of
time, even as sparse prices are informative.
Cremers and Weinbaum [2010] find that stocks with relatively expensive calls
(stocks with both a high volatility spread and a high change in the volatility spread)
outperform stocks with relatively expensive puts (stocks with both a low volatility
spread and a low change in the volatility spread) by 50 basis points per week. This
degree of predictability is larger when option liquidity is high and stock liquidity
is low.
In line with these observations, useful features can be extracted from comput-
ing the put-call implied stock price, derived from option trades. Futures prices only
represent mean or expected future values. But option prices allow us to derive the
entire distribution of outcomes being priced. An ML algorithm can search for pat-
terns across the Greek letters quoted at various strikes and expiration dates.
19.6.5
Serial Correlation of Signed Order Flow
Toth et al. [2011] study the signed order flow of London Stock Exchange stocks,
and find that order signs are positively autocorrelated for many days. They attribute
this observation to two candidate explanations: Herding and order splitting. They
conclude that on timescales of less than a few hours, the persistence of order flow is
overwhelmingly due to splitting rather than herding.
Given that market microstructure theory attributes the persistency of order flow
imbalance to the presence of informed traders, it makes sense to measure the strength
of such persistency through the serial correlation of the signed volumes. Such a fea-
ture would be complementary to the features we studied in Section 19.5.
19.7
WHAT IS MICROSTRUCTURAL INFORMATION?
Let me conclude this chapter by addressing what I consider to be a major flaw in the
market microstructure literature. Most articles and books on this subject study asym-
metric information, and how strategic agents utilize it to profit from market makers.
But how is information exactly defined in the context of trading? Unfortunately, there
is no widely accepted definition of information in a microstructural sense, and the
literature uses this concept in a surprisingly loose, rather informal way (L´opez de
Prado [2017]). This section proposes a proper definition of information, founded on
signal processing, that can be applied to microstructural studies.

## Page 323

MICROSTRUCTURAL FEATURES
Consider a features matrix X = {Xt}t=1,…,T that contains information typically
used by market makers to determine whether they should provide liquidity at a par-
ticular level, or cancel their passive quotes. For example, the columns could be all of
the features discussed in this chapter, like VPIN, Kyle’s lambda, cancellation rates,
etc. Matrix X has one row for each decision point. For example, a market maker may
reconsider the decision to either provide liquidity or pull out of the market every
time 10,000 contracts are traded, or whenever there is a significant change in prices
(recall sampling methods in Chapter 2), etc. First, we derive an array y = {yt}t=1,…,T
that assigns a label 1 to an observation that resulted in a market-making profit, and
labels as 0 an observation that resulted in a market-making loss (see Chapter 3 for
labeling methods). Second, we fit a classifier on the training set (X, y). Third, as new
out-of-sample observations arrive 𝜏> T, we use the fit classifier to predict the label̂
y𝜏= E𝜏[y𝜏|X]. Fourth, we derive the cross-entropy loss of these predictions, L𝜏, as
described in Chapter 9, Section 9.4. Fifth, we fit a kernel density estimator (KDE) on
the array of negative cross-entropy losses, {−Lt}t=T+1,…,𝜏, to derive its cumulative
distribution function, F. Sixth, we estimate the microstructural information at time t
as 𝜙𝜏= F[−L𝜏], where 𝜙𝜏∈(0, 1).
This microstructural information can be understood as the complexity faced by
market makers’ decision models. Under normal market conditions, market makers
produce informed forecasts with low cross-entropy loss, and are able to profit from
providing liquidity to position takers. However, in the presence of (asymmetrically)
informed traders, market makers produce uninformed forecasts, as measured by high
cross-entropy loss, and they are adversely selected. In other words, microstructural
information can only be defined and measured relative to the predictive power of
market makers. The implication is that {𝜙𝜏} should become an important feature in
your financial ML toolkit.
Consider the events of the flash crash of May 6, 2010. Market makers wrongly
predicted that their passive quotes sitting on the bid could be filled and sold back at
a higher level. The crash was not caused by a single inaccurate prediction, but by the
accumulation of thousands of prediction errors (Easley et al. [2011]). If market mak-
ers had monitored the rising cross-entropy loss of their predictions, they would have
recognized the presence of informed traders and the dangerously rising probability
of adverse selection. That would have allowed them to widen the bid-ask spread to
levels that would have stopped the order flow imbalance, as sellers would no longer
have been willing to sell at those discounts. Instead, market makers kept providing
liquidity to sellers at exceedingly generous levels, until eventually they were forced to
stop-out, triggering a liquidity crisis that shocked markets, regulators, and academics
for months and years.

CHAPTER 20
Multiprocessing and Vectorization
20.1
MOTIVATION
Multiprocessing is essential to ML. ML algorithms are computationally intensive,
and they will require an efficient use of all your CPUs, servers, and clusters. For
this reason, most of the functions presented throughout this book were designed
for asynchronous multiprocessing. For example, we have made frequent use of a
mysterious function called mpPandasObj, without ever defining it. In this chap-
ter we will explain what this function does. Furthermore, we will study in detail
how to develop multiprocessing engines. The structure of the programs presented
in this chapter is agnostic to the hardware architecture used to execute them,
whether we employ the cores of a single server or cores distributed across mul-
tiple interconnected servers (e.g., in a high-performance computing cluster or a
cloud).
20.2
VECTORIZATION EXAMPLE
Vectorization, also known as array programming, is the simplest example of paral-
lelization, whereby an operation is applied at once to the entire set of values. As a
minimal example, suppose that you need to do a brute search through a 3-dimensional
space, with 2 nodes per dimension. The un-vectorized implementation of that Carte-
sian product will look something like Snippet 20.1. How would this code look if you
had to search through 100 dimensions, or if the number of dimensions was defined
by the user during runtime?

for c in dict0['c']:
print {'a':a,'b':b,'c':c}
A vectorized solution would replace all explicit iterators (e.g., For. . .loops)
with matrix algebra operations or compiled iterators or generators. Snippet 20.2
implements the vectorized version of Snippet 20.1. The vectorized version is prefer-
able for four reasons: (1) slow nested For. . .loops are replaced with fast itera-
tors; (2) the code infers the dimensionality of the mesh from the dimensionality of
dict0; (3) we could run 100 dimensions without having to modify the code, or need
100 For. . .loops; and (4) under the hood, Python can run operations in C or
C + + .

SINGLE-THREAD VS. MULTITHREADING VS.
MULTIPROCESSING
A modern computer has multiple CPU sockets. Each CPU has many cores (proces-
sors), and each core has several threads. Multithreading is the technique by which
several applications are run in parallel on two or more threads under the same core.
One advantage of multithreading is that, because the applications share the same core,
they share the same memory space. That introduces the risk that several applications
may write on the same memory space at the same time. To prevent that from hap-
pening, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) assigns write access to one thread per core
at a time. Under the GIL, Python’s multithreading is limited to one thread per pro-
cessor. For this reason, Python achieves parallelism through multiprocessing rather
than through actual multithreading. Processors do not share the same memory space,
hence multiprocessing does not risk writing to the same memory space; however, that
also makes it harder to share objects between processes.

## Page 332

SINGLE-THREAD VS. MULTITHREADING VS. MULTIPROCESSING
305
Python functions implemented for running on a single-thread will use only a frac-
tion of a modern computer’s, server’s, or cluster’s power. Let us see an example of
how a simple task can be run inefficiently when implemented for single-thread exe-
cution. Snippet 20.3 finds the earliest time 10,000 Gaussian processes of length 1,000
touch a symmetric double barrier of width 50 times the standard deviation.

Compare this implementation with Snippet 20.4. Now the code splits the previous
problem into 24 tasks, one per processor. The tasks are then run asynchronously in
parallel, using 24 processors. If you run the same code on a cluster with 5000 CPUs,
the elapsed time will be about 1/5000 of the single-thread implementation.

Moreover, you could implement the same code to multiprocess a vectorized func-
tion, as we did with function applyPtSlOnT1 in Chapter 3, where parallel processes
execute subroutines that include vectorized pandas objects. In this way, you will
achieve two levels of parallelization at once. But why stop there? You could achieve
three levels of parallelization at once by running multiprocessed instances of vector-
ized code in an HPC cluster, where each node in the cluster provides the third level
of parallelization. In the next sections, we will explain how multiprocessing works.
20.4
ATOMS AND MOLECULES
When preparing jobs for parallelization, it is useful to distinguish between atoms
and molecules. Atoms are indivisible tasks. Rather than carrying out all these tasks
sequentially in a single thread, we want to group them into molecules, which can be
processed in parallel using multiple processors. Each molecule is a subset of atoms
that will be processed sequentially, by a callback function, using a single thread. Par-
allelization takes place at the molecular level.
20.4.1
Linear Partitions
The simplest way to form molecules is to partition a list of atoms in subsets of equal
size, where the number of subsets is the minimum between the number of processors
and the number of atoms. For N subsets we need to find the N + 1 indices that enclose
the partitions. This logic is demonstrated in Snippet 20.5.

It is common to encounter operations that involve two nested loops. For example,
computing a SADF series (Chapter 17), evaluating multiple barrier touches (Chapter
3), or computing a covariance matrix on misaligned series. In these situations, a linear
partition of the atomic tasks would be inefficient, because some processors would
have to solve a much larger number of operations than others, and the calculation
time will depend on the heaviest molecule. A partial solution is to partition the atomic
tasks in a number of jobs that is a multiple of the number of processors, then front-
load the jobs queue with the heavy molecules. In this way, the light molecules will
be assigned to processors that have completed the heavy molecules first, keeping all
CPUs busy until the job queue is depleted. In the next section, we will discuss a more
complete solution. Figure 20.1 plots a linear partition of 20 atomic tasks of equal
complexity into 6 molecules.
20.4.2
Two-Nested Loops Partitions
Consider
two
nested
loops,
where
the
outer
loop
iterates
i = 1, … , N
and the inner loop iterates j = 1, … , i. We can order these atomic tasks
{(i, j)|1 ≤j ≤i, i = 1, … , N} as a lower triangular matrix (including the main
diagonal). This entails 1
2N(N −1) + N = 1
2N(N + 1) operations, where 1
2N(N −1)
are off-diagonal and N are diagonal. We would like to parallelize these tasks by
partitioning the atomic tasks into M subsets of rows, {Sm}m=1,…,M, each composed
of approximately
1
2MN(N + 1) tasks. The following algorithm determines the rows
that constitute each subset (a molecule).

MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
The first subset, S1, is composed of the first r1 rows, that is, S1 = {1, … , r1}, for a
total number of items 1
2r1(r1 + 1). Then, r1 must satisfy the condition 1
2r1(r1 + 1) =
1
2M N(N + 1). Solving for r1, we obtain the positive root
r1 = −1 +
√
1 + 4N(N + 1)M−1
2
The second subset contains rows S2 = {r1 + 1, … , r2}, for a total number of items
1
2(r2 + r1 + 1)(r2 −r1). Then, r2 must satisfy the condition 1
2(r2 + r1 + 1)(r2 −r1) =
1
2M N(N + 1). Solving for r2, we obtain the positive root
r2 =
−1 +
√
1 + 4(r2
1 + r1 + N(N + 1)M−1)
2
We can repeat the same argument for a future subset Sm = {rm−1 + 1, … , rm},
with a total number of items 1
2(rm + rm−1 + 1)(rm −rm−1). Then, rm must satisfy the
condition 1
2(rm + rm−1 + 1)(rm −rm−1) =
1
2MN(N + 1). Solving for rm, we obtain the
positive root
rm =
−1 +
√
1 + 4(r2
m−1 + rm−1 + N(N + 1)M−1)
2
And it is easy to see that rm reduces to r1 where rm−1 = r0 = 0. Because row num-
bers are positive integers, the above results are rounded to the nearest natural number.
This may mean that some partitions’ sizes may deviate slightly from the
1
2M N(N + 1)
target. Snippet 20.6 implements this logic.

A two-nested loops partition of atoms into molecules
If the outer loop iterates i = 1, … , N and the inner loop iterates j = i, … , N, we can
order these atomic tasks {(i, j) |1 ≤i ≤j , j = 1, … , N} as an upper triangular matrix
(including the main diagonal). In this case, the argument upperTriang= True must
be passed to function nestedParts. For the curious reader, this is a special case of
the bin packing problem. Figure 20.2 plots a two-nested loops partition of atoms of
increasing complexity into molecules. Each of the resulting 6 molecules involves a
similar amount of work, even though some atomic tasks are up to 20 times harder
than others.
20.5
MULTIPROCESSING ENGINES
It would be a mistake to write a parallelization wrapper for each multiprocessed func-
tion. Instead, we should develop a library that can parallelize unknown functions,
regardless of their arguments and output structure. That is the goal of a multiprocess-
ing engine. In this section, we will study one such engine, and once you understand
the logic, you will be ready to develop your own, including all sorts of customized
properties.
20.5.1
Preparing the Jobs
In previous chapters we have made frequent use of the mpPandasObj. That function
receives six arguments, of which four are optional:

## Page 337

310
MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
r func: A callback function, which will be executed in parallel
r pdObj: A tuple containing:
◦The name of the argument used to pass molecules to the callback function
◦A list of indivisible tasks (atoms), which will be grouped into molecules
r numThreads: The number of threads that will be used in parallel (one processor
per thread)
r mpBatches: Number of parallel batches (jobs per core)
r linMols: Whether partitions will be linear or double-nested
r kargs: Keyword arguments needed by func
Snippet 20.7 lists how mpPandasObj works. First, atoms are grouped into
molecules, using linParts (equal number of atoms per molecule) or nestedParts
(atoms distributed in a lower-triangular structure). When mpBatches is greater than
1, there will be more molecules than cores. Suppose that we divide a task into 10
molecules, where molecule 1 takes twice as long as the rest. If we run this process in
10 cores, 9 of the cores will be idle half of the runtime, waiting for the first core to pro-
cess molecule 1. Alternatively, we could set mpBatches=10 so as to divide that task
in 100 molecules. In doing so, every core will receive equal workload, even though
the first 10 molecules take as much time as the next 20 molecules. In this example,
the run with mpBatches=10 will take half of the time consumed by mpBatches=1.
Second, we form a list of jobs. A job is a dictionary containing all the informa-
tion needed to process a molecule, that is, the callback function, its keyword argu-
ments, and the subset of atoms that form the molecule. Third, we will process the
jobs sequentially if numThreads==1 (see Snippet 20.8), and in parallel otherwise
(see Section 20.5.2). The reason that we want the option to run jobs sequentially is
for debugging purposes. It is not easy to catch a bug when programs are run in mul-
tiple processors.1 Once the code is debugged, we will want to use numThreads > 1.
Fourth, we stitch together the output from every molecule into a single list, series, or
dataframe.

when scrutinized. Multiprocessing bugs are a prime example.

Asynchronous Calls
Python has a parallelization library called multiprocessing. This library is the
basis for multiprocessing engines such as joblib,2 which is the engine used by
many sklearn algorithms.3 Snippet 20.9 illustrates how to do an asynchronous call
to Python’s multiprocessing library. The reportProgress function keeps us
informed about the percentage of jobs completed.

Unwrapping the Callback
In Snippet 20.9, the instruction pool.imap_unordered() parallelized expand-
Call, by running each item in jobs (a molecule) in a single thread. Snippet 20.10
lists expandCall, which unwraps the items (atoms) in the job (molecule), and exe-
cutes the callback function. This little function is the trick at the core of the multipro-
cessing engine: It transforms a dictionary into a task. Once you understand the role
it plays, you will be able to develop your own engines.

Pickle/Unpickle Objects
Multiprocessing must pickle methods in order to assign them to different processors.
The problem is, bound methods are not pickable.4 The work around is to add func-
tionality to your engine, that tells the library how to deal with this kind of objects.
Snippet 20.11 contains the instructions that should be listed at the top of your mul-
tiprocessing engine library. If you are curious about the precise reason this piece of
code is needed, you may want to read Ascher et al. [2005], Section 7.5.

20.5.5
Output Reduction
Suppose that you divide a task into 24 molecules, with the goal that the engine assigns
each molecule to one available core. Function processJobs in Snippet 20.9 will
capture the 24 outputs and store them in a list. This approach is effective in problems
that do not involve large outputs. If the outputs must be combined into a single output,
first we will wait until the last molecule is completed, and then we will process the
items in the list. The latency added by this post-processing should not be significant,
as long as the outputs are small in size and number.
However, when the outputs consume a lot of RAM, and they need to be combined
into a single output, storing all those outputs in a list may cause a memory error. It
would be better to perform the output reduction operation on the fly, as the results
are returned asynchronously by func, rather than waiting for the last molecule to
be completed. We can address this concern by improving processJobs. In particular,

multiprocessing-pool-ma.

MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
we are going to pass three additional arguments that determine how the molecular
outputs must be reduced into a single output. Snippet 20.12 lists an enhanced version
of processJobs, which contains three new arguments:
r redux: This is a callback to the function that carries out the reduction.
For example, redux= pd.DataFrame.add, if output dataframes ought to be
summed up.
r reduxArgs: This is a dictionary that contains the keyword arguments that must
be passed to redux (if any). For example, if redux= pd.DataFrame.join,
then a possibility is reduxArgs={'how':'outer'}.
r reduxInPlace: A boolean, indicating whether the
redux operation
should happen in-place or not. For example, redux= dict.update and
redux= list.append require reduxInPlace= True, since appending a list
and updating a dictionary are both in-place operations.

# Process asynchronous output, report progress
for i,out_ in enumerate(imap,1):
if out is None:
if redux is None:out,redux,reduxInPlace=[out_],list.append,True
else:out=copy.deepcopy(out_)

if isinstance(out,(pd.Series,pd.DataFrame)):out=out.sort_index()

Now that processJobsRedux knows what to do with the outputs, we can also
enhance mpPandasObj from Snippet 20.7. In Snippet 20.13, the new function
mpJobList passes the three output reduction arguments to processJobsRedux.

MULTIPROCESSING EXAMPLE
What we have presented so far in this chapter can be used to speed-up, by several
orders of magnitude, many lengthy and large-scale mathematical operations. In this
section we will illustrate an additional motivation for multiprocessing: memory man-
agement.
Suppose that you have conducted a spectral decomposition of a covariance matrix
of the form Z′Z, as we did in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2, where Z has size TxN. This
has resulted in an eigenvectors matrix W and an eigenvalues matrix Λ, such that
Z′ZW = WΛ. Now you would like to derive the orthogonal principal components
that explain a user-defined portion of the total variance, 0 ≤𝜏≤1. In order to do
that, we compute P = Z̃W, wherẽ W contains the first M ≤N columns of W, such that
(∑M
m=1 Λm,m)(∑N
n=1 Λn,n)−1 ≥𝜏. The computation of P = Z̃W can be parallelized by
noting that
P = Z̃W =
B
∑
b=1
Zb̃Wb
where Zb is a sparse TxN matrix with only TxNb items (the rest are empty),̃ Wb is a
NxM matrix with only NbxM items (the rest are empty), and ∑B
b=1 Nb = N. This spar-
sity is created by dividing the set of columns into a partition of B subsets of columns,
and loading into Zb only the bth subset of the columns. This notion of sparsity may
sound a bit complicated at first, however Snippet 20.14 demonstrates how pandas

## Page 343

316
MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
allows us to implement it in a seamless way. Function getPCs receives̃ W through
the argument eVec. The argument molecules contains a subset of the file names in
ﬁleNames, where each file represents Zb. The key concept to grasp is that we compute
the dot product of a Zb with the slice of the rows of̃ Wb defined by the columns in Zb,
and that molecular results are aggregated on the fly (redux= pd.DataFrame.add).
SNIPPET 20.14
PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS FOR A SUBSET OF THE
COLUMNS
pcs=mpJobList(getPCs,('molecules',ﬁleNames),numThreads=24,mpBatches=1,
path=path,eVec=eVec,redux=pd.DataFrame.add)
#——————————————————————————————————————
def getPCs(path,molecules,eVec):
# get principal components by loading one file at a time
pcs=None
for i in molecules:
df0=pd.read_csv(path+i,index_col=0,parse_dates=True)
if pcs is None:pcs=np.dot(df0.values,eVec.loc[df0.columns].values)
else:pcs+=np.dot(df0.values,eVec.loc[df0.columns].values)
pcs=pd.DataFrame(pcs,index=df0.index,columns=eVec.columns)
return pcs
This approach presents two advantages: First, because getPCs loads dataframes
Zb sequentially, for a sufficiently large B, the RAM is not exhausted. Second, mpJob-
List executes the molecules in parallel, hence speeding up the calculations.
In real life ML applications, we often encounter datasets where Z contains billions
of datapoints. As this example demonstrates, parallelization is not only beneficial in
terms of reducing run time. Many problems could not be solved without paralleliza-
tion, as a matter of memory limitations, even if we were willing to wait longer.

CHAPTER 21
Brute Force and Quantum Computers
21.1
MOTIVATION
Discrete mathematics appears naturally in multiple ML problems, including hier-
archical clustering, grid searches, decisions based on thresholds, and integer opti-
mization. Sometimes, these problems do not have a known analytical (closed-form)
solution, or even a heuristic to approximate it, and our only hope is to search for it
through brute force. In this chapter, we will study how a financial problem, intractable
to modern supercomputers, can be reformulated as an integer optimization problem.
Such a representation makes it amenable to quantum computers. From this example
the reader can infer how to translate his particular financial ML intractable problem
into a quantum brute force search.
21.2
COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION
Combinatorial optimization problems can be described as problems where there is a
finite number of feasible solutions, which result from combining the discrete values
of a finite number of variables. As the number of feasible combinations grows, an
exhaustive search becomes impractical. The traveling salesman problem is an exam-
ple of a combinatorial optimization problem that is known to be NP hard (Woeginger
[2003]), that is, the category of problems that are at least as hard as the hardest prob-
lems solvable is nondeterministic polynomial time.
What makes an exhaustive search impractical is that standard computers evaluate
and store the feasible solutions sequentially. But what if we could evaluate and store
all feasible solutions at once? That is the goal of quantum computers. Whereas the
bits of a standard computer can only adopt one of two possible states ({0, 1}) at once,
quantum computers rely on qubits, which are memory elements that may hold a linear
superposition of both states. In theory, quantum computers can accomplish this thanks

## Page 347

BRUTE FORCE AND QUANTUM COMPUTERS
to quantum mechanical phenomena. In some implementations, qubits can support
currents flowing in two directions at once, hence providing the desired superposition.
This linear superposition property is what makes quantum computers ideally suited
for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. See Williams [2010] for
a general treatise on the capabilities of quantum computers.
The best way to understand this approach is through a particular example. We
will now see how a dynamic portfolio optimization problem subject to generic trans-
action cost functions can be represented as a combinatorial optimization problem,
tractable to quantum computers. Unlike Garleanu and Pedersen [2012], we will not
assume that the returns are drawn from an IID Gaussian distribution. This problem
is particularly relevant to large asset managers, as the costs from excessive turnover
and implementation shortfall may critically erode the profitability of their investment
strategies.
21.3
THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
Consider a set on assets X = {xi}, i = 1, … , N, with returns following a multivari-
ate Normal distribution at each time horizon h = 1, … , H, with varying mean and
variance. We will assume that the returns are multivariate Normal, time-independent,
however not identically distributed through time. We define a trading trajectory as
an NxH matrix 𝜔that determines the proportion of capital allocated to each of the N
assets over each of the H horizons. At a particular horizon h = 1, … , H, we have a
forecasted mean 𝜇h, a forecasted variance Vh and a forecasted transaction cost func-
tion 𝜏h [𝜔]. This means that, given a trading trajectory 𝜔, we can compute a vector of
expected investment returns r, as
r = diag[𝜇′𝜔] −𝜏[𝜔]
where 𝜏[𝜔] can adopt any functional form. Without loss of generality, consider the
following:
r 𝜏1 [𝜔] = ∑N
n=1 cn,1
√
||𝜔n,1 −𝜔∗
n||
r 𝜏h [𝜔] = ∑N
n=1 cn,h
√
||𝜔n,h −𝜔n,h−1||, for h = 2, … , H
r 𝜔∗
n is the initial allocation to instrument n, n = 1, … , N
𝜏[𝜔] is an Hx1 vector of transaction costs. In words, the transaction costs associ-
ated with each asset are the sum of the square roots of the changes in capital allo-
cations, re-scaled by an asset-specific factor Ch = {cn,h}n=1,…,N that changes with
h. Thus, Ch is an Nx1 vector that determines the relative transaction cost across
assets.

This problem attempts to compute a global dynamic optimum, in contrast to the
static optimum derived by mean-variance optimizers (see Chapter 16). Note that non-
continuous transaction costs are embedded in r. Compared to standard portfolio opti-
mization applications, this is not a convex (quadratic) programming problem for at
least three reasons: (1) Returns are not identically distributed, because 𝜇h and Vh
change with h. (2) Transaction costs 𝜏h [𝜔] are non-continuous and changing with h.
(3) The objective function SR [r] is not convex. Next, we will show how to calcu-
late solutions without making use of any analytical property of the objective function
(hence the generalized nature of this approach).
21.5
AN INTEGER OPTIMIZATION APPROACH
The generality of this problem makes it intractable to standard convex optimization
techniques. Our solution strategy is to discretize it so that it becomes amenable to
integer optimization. This in turn allows us to use quantum computing technology to
find the optimal solution.
21.5.1
Pigeonhole Partitions
Suppose that we count the number of ways that K units of capital can be allocated
among N assets, where we assume K > N. This is equivalent to finding the number
of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + … + xN = K, which has the nice combina-
torial solution
(
K + N −1
N −1
)
. This bears a similarity to the classic integer partitioning
problem in number theory for which Hardy and Ramanujan (and later, Rademacher)
proved an asymptotic expression (see Johansson [2012]). While order does not mat-
ter in the partition problem, order is very relevant to the problem we have at hand.

Partitions (1, 2, 3) and (3, 2, 1) must be treated as different
For example, if K = 6 and N = 3, partitions (1, 2, 3) and (3, 2, 1) must be treated as
different (obviously (2, 2, 2) does not need to be permutated). Figure 21.1 illustrates
how order is important when allocating 6 units of capital to 3 different assets. This
means that we must consider all distinct permutations of each partition. Even though
there is a nice combinatorial solution to find the number of such allocations, it may
still be computationally intensive to find as K and N grow large. However, we can use
Stirling’s approximation to easily arrive at an estimate.
Snippet 21.1 provides an efficient algorithm to generate the set of all parti-
tions, pK,N = {{pi}i=1,…,N|pi ∈𝕎, ∑N
i=1 pi = K}, where 𝕎are the natural numbers
including zero (whole numbers).

Feasible Static Solutions
We would like to compute the set of all feasible solutions at any given hori-
zon h, which we denote Ω. Consider a partition set of K units into N assets,
pK,N. For each partition {pi}i=1,…,N ∈pK,N, we can define a vector of abso-
lute weights such that |𝜔i| = 1
K pi, where ∑N
i=1 |𝜔i| = 1 (the full-investment con-
straint). This full-investment (without leverage) constraint implies that every weight
can be either positive or negative, so for every vector of absolute weights
{|𝜔i|}i=1,…,N we can generate 2N vectors of (signed) weights. This is accom-
plished by multiplying the items in {|𝜔i|}i=1,…,N with the items of the Carte-
sian product of {−1, 1} with N repetitions. Snippet 21.2 shows how to gen-
erate the set Ω of all vectors of weights associated with all partitions, Ω =

21.5.3
Evaluating Trajectories
Given the set of all vectors Ω, we define the set of all possible trajectories Φ as the
Cartesian product of Ω with H repetitions. Then, for every trajectory we can evalu-
ate its transaction costs and SR, and select the trajectory with optimal performance
across Φ. Snippet 21.3 implements this functionality. The object params is a list of
dictionaries that contain the values of C, 𝜇, V.

tcost_=evalTCosts(w_,params)
sr_=evalSR(params,w_,tcost_) # evaluate trajectory
if sr is None or sr<sr_: # store trajectory if better
sr,w=sr_,w_.copy()
return w
Note that this procedure selects an globally optimal trajectory without relying on
convex optimization. A solution will be found even if the covariance matrices are
ill-conditioned, transaction cost functions are non-continuous, etc. The price we pay
for this generality is that calculating the solution is extremely computationally inten-
sive. Indeed, evaluating all trajectories is similar to the traveling-salesman problem.

A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
325
Digital computers are inadequate for this sort of NP-complete or NP-hard problems;
however, quantum computers have the advantage of evaluating multiple solutions at
once, thanks to the property of linear superposition.
The approach presented in this chapter set the foundation for Rosenberg et
al. [2016], which solved the optimal trading trajectory problem using a quantum
annealer. The same logic can be applied to a wide range on financial problems
involving path dependency, such as a trading trajectory. Intractable ML algorithm
can be discretized and translated into a brute force search, intended for a quantum
computer.

A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
Below we illustrate how the global optimum can be found in practice, using a digital
computer. A quantum computer would evaluate all trajectories at once, whereas the
digital computer does this sequentially.

MOTIVATION
This chapter provides an introduction to the Computational Intelligence and Forecast-
ing Technologies (CIFT) project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).
The main objective of CIFT is to promote the use of high-performance computing
(HPC) tools and techniques for analysis of streaming data. After noticing the data
volume being given as the explanation for the five-month delay for SEC and CFTC
to issue their report on the 2010 Flash Crash, LBNL started the CIFT project to apply
HPC technologies to manage and analyze financial data. Making timely decisions
with streaming data is a requirement for many business applications, such as avoid-
ing impending failure in the electric power grid or a liquidity crisis in financial mar-
kets. In all these cases, the HPC tools are well suited in handling the complex data
dependencies and providing a timely solution. Over the years, CIFT has worked on
a number of different forms of streaming data, including those from vehicle traffic,
electric power grid, electricity usage, and so on. The following sections explain the
key features of HPC systems, introduce a few special tools used on these systems,
and provide examples of streaming data analyses using these HPC tools.

REGULATORY RESPONSE TO THE FLASH CRASH OF 2010
On May 6, 2010, at about 2:45 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Daylight Time), the U.S. stock
market experienced a nearly 10% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only to
recover most of the loss a few minutes later. It took about five months for regulatory

agencies to come up with an investigation report. In front of a congressional panel
investigating the crash, the data volume (~20 terabytes) was given as the primary rea-
son for the long delay. Since HPC systems, such as those at National Energy Research
Scientific Computing (NERSC) center,1 routinely work with hundreds of terabytes
in minutes, we should have no problem processing the data from financial markets.
This led to the establishment of the CIFT project with the mission to apply the HPC
techniques and tools for financial data analysis.
A key aspect of financial big data is that it consists of mostly time series. Over the
years, the CIFT team, along with numerous collaborators, has developed techniques
to analyze many different forms of data streams and time series. This chapter provides
a brief introduction to the HPC system including both hardware (Section 22.4) and
software (Section 22.5), and recounts a few successful use cases (Section 22.6). We
conclude with a summary of our vision and work so far and also provide contact
information for interested readers.
22.3
BACKGROUND
Advances in computing technology have made it considerably easier to look for com-
plex patterns. This pattern-finding capability is behind a number of recent scientific
breakthroughs, such as the discovery of the Higgs particle (Aad et al. [2016]) and
gravitational waves (Abbot et al. [2016]). This same capability is also at the core
of many internet companies, for example, to match users with advertisers (Zeff and
Aronson [1999], Yen et al. [2009]). However, the hardware and software used in sci-
ence and in commerce are quite different. The HPC tools have some critical advan-
tages that should be useful in a variety of business applications.
Tools for scientists are typically built around high-performance computing (HPC)
platforms, while the tools for commercial applications are built around cloud comput-
ing platforms. For the purpose of sifting through large volumes of data to find useful
patterns, the two approaches have been shown to work well. However, the marquee
application for HPC systems is large-scale simulation, such as weather models used
for forecasting regional storms in the next few days (Asanovic et al. [2006]). In con-
trast, the commercial cloud was initially motivated by the need to process a large
number of independent data objects concurrently (data parallel tasks).
For our work, we are primarily interested in analyses of streaming data. In particu-
lar, high-speed complex data streams, such as those from sensor networks monitoring
our nation’s electric power grid and highway systems. This streaming workload is not
ideal for either HPC systems or cloud systems as we discuss below, but we believe
that the HPC ecosystem has more to offer to address the streaming data analysis than
the cloud ecosystem does.
Cloud systems were originally designed for parallel data tasks, where a large num-
ber of independent data objects can be processed concurrently. The system is thus

mation about NERSC can be found at http://nersc.gov/.

designed for high throughput, not for producing real-time responses. However, many
business applications require real-time or near-real-time responses. For example, an
instability event in an electric power grid could develop and grow into a disaster in
minutes; finding the tell-tale signature quickly enough would avert the disaster. Simi-
larly, signs of emerging illiquidity events have been identified in the financial research
literature; quickly finding these signs during the active market trading hours could
offer options to prevent shocks to the market and avoid flash crashes. The ability to
prioritize quick turnaround time is essential in these cases.
A data stream is by definition available progressively; therefore, there may not be a
large number of data objects to be processed in parallel. Typically, only a fixed amount
of the most recent data records are available for analysis. In this case, an effective way
to harness the computing power of many central processing units (CPUs) cores is to
divide the analytical work on a single data object (or a single time-step) to many CPU
cores. The HPC ecosystem has more advanced tools for this kind of work than the
cloud ecosystem does.
These are the main points that motivated our work. For a more thorough com-
parison of HPC systems and cloud systems, we refer interested readers to Asanovic
et al. [2006]. In particular, Fox et al. [2015] have created an extensive taxonomy for
describing the similarities and differences for any application scenario.
In short, we believe the HPC community has a lot to offer to advance the state-of-
the-art for streaming analytics. The CIFT project was established with a mission to
transfer LBNL’s HPC expertise to streaming business applications. We are pursuing
this mission via collaboration, demonstration, and tool development.
To evaluate the potential uses of HPC technology, we have spent time working
with various applications. This process not only exposes our HPC experts to a variety
of fields, but also makes it possible for us to gather financial support to establish a
demonstration facility.
With the generous gifts from a number of early supporters of this effort, we estab-
lished a substantial computing cluster dedicated to this work. This dedicated com-
puter (named dirac1) allows users to utilize an HPC system and evaluate their appli-
cations for themselves.
We are also engaged in a tool development effort to make HPC systems more
usable for streaming data analysis. In the following sections, we will describe the
hardware and software of the dedicated CIFT machine, as well as some of the demon-
stration and tool development efforts. Highlights include improving the data handling
speed by 21-fold, and increasing the speed of computing an early warning indicator
by 720-fold.

HPC HARDWARE
Legend has it that the first generation of big data systems was built with the spare
computer components gleaned from a university campus. This is likely an urban
legend, but it underscores an important point about the difference between HPC
systems and cloud systems. Theoretically, a HPC system is built with custom

FIGURE 22.1
Schematic of the Magellan cluster (circa 2010), an example of HPC computer cluster
high-cost components, while cloud systems are built with standard low-cost com-
modity components. In practice, since the worldwide investment in HPC systems
is much smaller than that of personal computers, there is no way for manufacturers
to produce custom components just for the HPC market. The truth is that HPC
systems are largely assembled from commodity components just like cloud systems.
However, due to their different target applications, there are some differences in
their choices of the components.
Let us describe the computing elements, storage system, and networking system in
turn. Figure 22.1 is a high-level schematic diagram representing the key components
of the Magellan cluster around year 2010 (Jackson et al. [2010]; Yelick et al. [2011]).
The computer elements include both CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs).
These CPUs and GPUs are commercial products in almost all the cases. For example,
the nodes on dirac1 use a 24-core 2.2Ghz Intel processor, which is common to cloud
computing systems. Currently, dirac1 does not contain GPUs.
The networking system consists of two parts: the InfiniBand network connecting
the components within the cluster, and the switched network connection to the out-
side world. In this particular example, the outside connections are labeled “ESNet”
and “ANI.” The InfiniBand network switches are also common in cloud computing
systems.
The storage system in Figure 1 includes both rotating disks and flash storage.
This combination is also common. What is different is that a HPC system typically
has its storage system concentrated outside of the computer nodes, while a typical
cloud computing system has its storage system distributed among the compute
nodes. These two approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages. For
example, the concentrated storage is typically exported as a global file system to all
computer nodes, which makes it easier to deal with data stored in files. However, this
requires a highly capable network connecting the CPUs and the disks. In contrast,

## Page 360

HPC HARDWARE
333
the distributed approach could use lower-capacity network because there is some
storage that is close to each CPU. Typically, a distributed file system, such as the
Google file system (Ghemawat, Gobioff, and Leung [2003]), is layered on top of a
cloud computing system to make the storage accessible to all CPUs.
In short, the current generation of HPC systems and cloud systems use pretty much
the same commercial hardware components. Their differences are primarily in the
arrangement of the storage systems and networking systems. Clearly, the difference
in the storage system designs could affect the application performance. However,
the virtualization layer of the cloud systems is likely the bigger cause of application
performance difference. In the next section, we will discuss another factor that could
have an even larger impact, namely software tools and libraries.
Virtualization is generally used in the cloud computing environment to make the
same hardware available to multiple users and to insulate one software environment
from another. This is one of the more prominent features distinguishing the cloud
computing environment from the HPC environment. In most cases, all three basic
components of a computer system—CPU, storage, and networking—are all virtual-
ized. This virtualization has many benefits. For example, an existing application can
run on a CPU chip without recompiling; many users can share the same hardware;
hardware faults could be corrected through the virtualization software; and appli-
cations on a failed compute node could be more easily migrated to another node.
However, this virtualization layer also imposes some runtime overhead and could
reduce application performance. For time-sensitive applications, this reduction in per-
formance could become a critical issue.
Tests show that the performance differences could be quite large. Next, we briefly
describe a performance study reported by Jackson et al [2010]. Figure 22.2 shows the
performance slowdown using different computer systems. The names below the hor-
izontal axis are different software packages commonly used at NERSC. The left bar
corresponds to the Commercial Cloud, the middle bar to Magellan, and the (some-
times missing) right bar to the EC2-Beta-Opt system. The non-optimized commercial

As the number of cores increases (horizontal axis), the virtualization overhead becomes
much more significant (circa 2010)
cloud instances run these software packages 2 to 10 times slower than on a NERSC
supercomputer. Even on the more expensive high-performance instances, there are
noticeable slowdowns.
Figure 22.3 shows a study of the main factor causing the slowdown with the soft-
ware package PARATEC. In Figure 2, we see that PARATEC took 53 times longer
to complete on the commercial cloud than on an HPC system. We observe from Fig-
ure 3 that, as the number of cores (horizontal axis) increases, the differences among
the measured performances (measured in TFLOP/s) become larger. In particular, the
line labeled “10G- TCPoEth Vm” barely increases as the number of cores grows. This
is the case where the network instance is using virtualized networking (TCP over Eth-
ernet). It clearly shows that the networking virtualization overhead is significant, to
the point of rendering the cloud useless.
The issue of virtualization overhead is widely recognized (Chen et al. [2015]).
There has been considerable research aimed at addressing both the I/O virtualization
overhead (Gordon et al. [2012]) as well as the networking virtualization overhead
(Dong et al. [2012]). As these state-of-the-art techniques are gradually being moved
into commercial products, we anticipate the overhead will decrease in the future, but
some overhead will inevitably remain.
To wrap up this section, we briefly touch on the economics of HPC versus cloud.
Typically, HPC systems are run by nonprofit research organizations and universi-
ties, while cloud systems are provided by commercial companies. Profit, customer
retention, and many other factors affect the cost of a cloud system (Armburst et al.
[2010]). In 2011, the Magellan project report stated that “Cost analysis shows that
DOE centers are cost competitive, typically 3–7 × less expensive, when compared to
commercial cloud providers” (Yelick et al. [2010]).
A group of high-energy physicists thought their use case was well-suited for
cloud computing and conducted a detailed study of a comparison study (Holzman
et al. [2017]). Their cost comparisons still show the commercial cloud offerings as

## Page 362

approximately 50% more expensive than dedicated HPC systems for comparable
computing tasks; however, the authors worked with severe limitations on data
ingress and egress to avoid potentially hefty charges on data movement. For complex
workloads, such as the streaming data analyses discussed in this book, we anticipate
that this HPC cost advantage will remain in the future. A 2016 National Academy of
Sciences study came to the same conclusion that even a long-term lease from Ama-
zon is likely 2 to 3 times more expensive than HPC systems to handle the expected
science workload from NSF (Box 6.2 from National Academies of Sciences, [2016]).
22.5
HPC SOFTWARE
Ironically, the real power of a supercomputer is in its specialized software. There are a
wide variety of software packages available for both HPC systems and cloud systems.
In most cases, the same software package is available on both platforms. Therefore,
we chose to focus on software packages that are unique to HPC systems and have the
potential to improve computational intelligence and forecasting technologies.
One noticeable feature of the HPC software ecosystem is that much of the appli-
cation software performs its own interprocessor communication through Message
Passing Interface (MPI). In fact, the cornerstone of most scientific computing books
is MPI (Kumar et al. [1994], Gropp, Lusk, and Skjellum [1999]). Accordingly, our
discussion of HPC software tools will start with MPI. As this book relies on data pro-
cessing algorithms, we will concentrate on data management tools (Shoshami and
Rotem [2010]).
22.5.1
Message Passing Interface
Message Passing Interface is a communication protocol for parallel computing
(Gropp, Lusk, and Skjellum [1999], Snir et al. [1988]). It defines a number of point-
to-point data exchange operations as well as some collective communication oper-
ations. The MPI standard was established based on several early attempts to build
portable communication libraries. The early implementation from Argonne National
Lab, named MPICH, was high performance, scalable, and portable. This helped MPI
to gain wide acceptance among scientific users.
The success of MPI is partly due to its separation of Language Independent Spec-
ifications (LIS) from its language bindings. This allows the same core function to
be provided to many different programming languages, which also contributes to
its acceptance. The first MPI standard specified ANSI C and Fortran-77 bindings
together with the LIS. The draft specification was presented to the user community
at the 1994 Supercomputing Conference.
Another key factor contributing to MPI’s success is the open-source license used
by MPICH. This license allows the vendors to take the source code to produce their
own custom versions, which allows the HPC system vendors to quickly produce their
own MPI libraries. To this day, all HPC systems support the familiar MPI on their
computers. This wide adoption also ensures that MPI will continue to be the favorite
communication protocol among the users of HPC systems.

Hierarchical Data Format 5
In describing the HPC hardware components, we noted that the storage systems in
an HPC platform are typically different from those in a cloud platform. Correspond-
ingly, the software libraries used by most users for accessing the storage systems are
different as well. This difference can be traced to the difference in the conceptual
models of data. Typically, HPC applications treat data as multi-dimensional arrays
and, therefore, the most popular I/O libraries on HPC systems are designed to work
with multi-dimensional arrays. Here, we describe the most widely used array format
library, HDF5 (Folk et al. [2011]).
HDF5 is the fifth iteration of the Hierarchical Data Format, produced by the HDF
Group.2 The basic unit of data in HDF5 is an array plus its associated information
such as attributes, dimensions, and data type. Together, they are known as a data set.
Data sets can be grouped into large units called groups, and groups can be organized
into high-level groups. This flexible hierarchical organization allows users to express
complex relationships among the data sets.
Beyond the basic library for organizing user data into files, the HDF Group also
provides a suite of tools and specialization of HDF5 for different applications. For
example, HDF5 includes a performance profiling tool. NASA has a specialization of
HDF5, named HDF5-EOS, for data from their Earth-Observing System (EOS); and
the next-generation DNA sequence community has produced a specialization named
BioHDF for their bioinformatics data.
HDF5 provides an efficient way for accessing the storage systems on HPC plat-
form. In tests, we have demonstrated that using HDF5 to store stock markets data
significantly speeds up the analysis operations. This is largely due to its efficient com-
pression/decompression algorithms that minimize network traffic and I/O operations,
which brings us to our next point.
22.5.3
In Situ Processing
Over the last few decades, CPU performance has roughly doubled every 18 months
(Moore’s law), while disk performance has been increasing less than 5% a year. This
difference has caused it to take longer and longer to write out the content of the CPU
memory. To address this issue, a number of research efforts have focused on in situ
analysis capability (Ayachit et al. [2016]).
Among the current generation of processing systems, the Adaptable I/O System
(ADIOS) is the most widely used (Liu et al. [2014]). It employs a number of data
transport engines that allow users to tap into the I/O stream and perform analytical
operations. This is useful because irrelevant data can be discarded in-flight, hence
avoiding its slow and voluminous storage. This same in situ mechanism also allows it
to complete write operations very quickly. In fact, it initially gained attention because
of its write speed. Since then, the ADIOS developers have worked with a number of
very large teams to improve their I/O pipelines and their analysis capability.

Because ADIOS supports streaming data accesses, it is also highly relevant to
CIFT work. In a number of demonstrations, ADIOS with ICEE transport engine was
able to complete distributed streaming data analysis in real-time (Choi et al. [2013]).
We will describe one of the use cases involving blobs in fusion plasma in the next
section.
To summarize, in situ data processing capability is another very useful tool from
the HPC ecosystem.
22.5.4
Convergence
We mentioned earlier that the HPC hardware market is a tiny part of the overall com-
puter hardware market. The HPC software market is even smaller compared to the
overall software market. So far, the HPC software ecosystem is largely maintained
by a number of small vendors along with some open-source contributors. Therefore,
HPC system users are under tremendous pressure to migrate to the better supported
cloud software systems. This is a significant driver for convergence between software
for HPC and software for cloud (Fox et al. [2015]).
Even though convergence appears to be inevitable, we advocate for a convergence
option that keeps the advantage of the software tools mentioned above. One of the
motivations of the CIFT project is to seek a way to transfer the above tools to the
computing environments of the future.

USE CASES
Data processing is such an important part of modern scientific research that some
researchers are calling it the fourth paradigm of science (Hey, Tansley, and Tolle
[2009]). In economics, the same data-driven research activities have led to the wildly
popular behavioral economics (Camerer and Loewenstein [2011]). Much of the recent
advances in data-driven research are based on machine learning applications (Qiu
et al. [2016], Rudin and Wagstaff [2014]). Their successes in a wide variety of fields,
such as planetary science and bioinformatics, have generated considerable interest
among researchers from diverse domains. In the rest of this section, we describe a
few examples applying advanced data analysis techniques to various fields, where
many of these use cases originated in the CIFT project.
22.6.1
Supernova Hunting
In astronomy, the determination of many important facts such as the expansion speed
of the universe, is performed by measuring the light from exploding type Ia super-
novae (Bloom et al. [2012]). The process of searching the night sky for exploding
supernovae is called synoptic imaging survey. The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)
is an example of such a synoptic survey (Nicholas et al. [2009]). The PTF telescopes
scan the night sky and produce a set of images every 45 minutes. The new image is
compared against the previous observations of the same patch of sky to determine

HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
FIGURE 22.4
Supernova SN 2011fe was discovered 11 hours after first evidence of explosion, as a
result of the extensive automation in classification of astronomical observations
what has changed and to classify the changes. Such identification and classification
tasks used to be performed by astronomers manually. However, the current number of
incoming images from the PTF telescopes is too large for manual inspection. An auto-
mated workflow for these image processing tasks has been developed and deployed
at a number of different computer centers.
Figure 22.4 shows the supernova that was identified earliest in its explosion pro-
cess. On August 23, 2011, a patch of the sky showed no sign of this star, but a faint
light showed up on August 24. This quick turnover allowed astronomers around the
world to perform detailed follow-up observations, which are important for determin-
ing the parameters related to the expansion of the universe.
The quick identification of this supernova is an important demonstration of the
machine learning capability of the automated workflow. This workflow processes the
incoming images to extract the objects that have changed since last observed. It then
classifies the changed object to determine a preliminary type based on the previous
training. Since follow-up resources for extracting novel science from fast-changing
transients are precious, the classification not only needs to indicate the assumed type
but also the likelihood and confidence of the classification. Using classification algo-
rithms trained on PTF data, the mislabeling of transients and variable stars has a
3.8% overall error rate. Additional work is expected to achieve higher accuracy rates
in upcoming surveys, such as for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

Blobs in Fusion Plasma

collaborations produce more and more data at progressively faster rates, the exist-
ing workflow management systems are hard-pressed to keep pace. A necessary
solution is to process, analyze, summarize, and reduce the data before it reaches the
relatively slow disk storage system, a process known as in-transit processing (or in-
flight analysis). Working with the ADIOS developers, we have implemented the ICEE
transport engine to dramatically increase the data-handling capability of collaborative
workflow systems (Choi et al. [2013]). This new feature significantly improved the
data flow management for distributed workflows. Tests showed that the ICEE engine
allowed a number of large international collaborations to make near real-time collabo-
rative decisions. Here, we briefly describe the fusion collaboration involving KSTAR.
KSTAR is a nuclear fusion reactor with fully superconducting magnets. It is
located in South Korea, but there are a number of associated research teams around
the world. During a run of a fusion experiment, some researchers control the physics
device at KSTAR, but others may want to participate by performing collaborative
analysis of the preceding runs of the experiment to provide advice on how to config-
ure the device for the next run. During the analysis of the experimental measurement
data, scientists might run simulations or examine previous simulations to study para-
metric choices. Typically, there may be a lapse of 10 to 30 minutes between two suc-
cessive runs, and all collaborative analyses need to complete during this time window
in order to affect the next run.
We have demonstrated the functionality of the ICEE workflow system with two
different types of data: one from the Electron Cyclotron Emission Imaging (ECEI)
data measured at KSTAR, and the other involving synthetic diagnostic data from the
XGC modelling. The distributed workflow engine needs to collect data from these
two sources, extract a feature known as blobs, track the movement of these blobs,
predict the movement of the blobs in the experimental measurements, and then pro-
vide advices on actions to be performed. Figure 22.5 shows how the ECEI data is
processed. The workflow for the XGC simulation data is similar to what is shown in
Figure 22.5, except that the XGC data is located at NERSC.

To be able to complete the above analytical tasks in real-time, effective data man-
agement with ICEE transport engine of ADIOS is only part of the story. The second
part is to detect blobs efficiently (Wu et al. [2016]). In this work, we need to reduce
the amount of data transported across wide-area networks by selecting only the nec-
essary chunks. We then identify all cells within the blobs and group these cells into
connected regions in space, where each connected region forms a blob. The new algo-
rithm we developed partitions the work into different CPU cores by taking full advan-
tage of the MPI for communication between the nodes and the shared memory among
the CPU cores on the same node. Additionally, we also updated the connected com-
ponent label algorithm to correctly identify blobs at the edge, which were frequently
missed by the earlier detection algorithms. Overall, our algorithm was able to iden-
tify blobs in a few milliseconds for each time step by taking full advantage of the
parallelism available in the HPC system.
22.6.3
Intraday Peak Electricity Usage
Utility companies are deploying advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to capture
electricity consumption in unprecedented spatial and temporal detail. This vast and
fast-growing stream of data provides an important testing ground for the predictive
capability based on big data analytical platforms (Kim et al. [2015]). These cutting-
edge data science techniques, together with behavioral theories, enable behavior ana-
lytics to gain novel insights into patterns of electricity consumption and their under-
lying drivers (Todd et al. [2014]).
As electricity cannot be easily stored, its generation must match consumption.
When the demand exceeds the generation capacity, a blackout will occur, typically
during the time when consumers need electricity the most. Because increasing gener-
ation capacity is expensive and requires years of time, regulators and utility compa-
nies have devised a number of pricing schemes intended to discourage unnecessary
consumption during peak demand periods.
To measure the effectiveness of a pricing policy on peak demand, one can analyze
the electricity usage data generated by AMI. Our work focuses on extracting base-
line models of household electricity usage for a behavior analytics study. The baseline
models would ideally capture the pattern of household electricity usage including all
features except the new pricing schemes. There are numerous challenges in establish-
ing such a model. For example, there are many features that could affect the usage
of electricity but for which no information is recorded, such as the temperature set
point of an air-conditioner or the purchase of a new appliance. Other features, such
as outdoor temperature, are known, but their impact is difficult to capture in simple
functions.
Our work developed a number of new baseline models that could satisfy the above
requirements. At present, the gold standard baseline is a well-designed randomized
control group. We showed that our new data-driven baselines could accurately pre-
dict the average electricity usage of the control group. For this evaluation, we use a
well-designed study from a region of the United States where the electricity usage is
the highest in the afternoon and evening during the months of May through August.

## Page 368

USE CASES
341
Though this work concentrates on demonstrating that the new baseline models are
effective for groups, we believe that these new models are also useful for studying
individual households in the future.
We explored a number of standard black-box approaches. Among machine learn-
ing methods, we found gradient tree boosting (GTB) to be more effective than oth-
ers. However, the most accurate GTB models require lagged variables as features
(for example, the electricity usage a day before and a week before). In our work, we
need to use the data from year T-1 to establish the baseline usage for year T and year
T + 1. The lagged variable for a day before and a week before would be incorporating
recent information not in year T-1. We attempted to modify the prediction procedure
to use the recent predictions in place of the actual measured values a day before and a
week before; however, our tests show that the prediction errors accumulate over time,
leading to unrealistic predictions a month or so into the summer season. This type of
accumulation of prediction errors is common to continuous prediction procedures for
time series.
To address the above issue, we devised a number of white-box approaches, the
most effective of which, known as LTAP, is reported here. LTAP is based on the fact
that the aggregate variable electricity usage per day is accurately described by a piece-
wise linear function of average daily temperature. This fact allows us to make pre-
dictions about the total daily electricity usage. By further assuming that the usage
profile of each household remains the same during the study, we are able to assign
the hourly usage values from the daily aggregate usage. This approach is shown to
be self-consistent; that is, the prediction procedure exactly reproduces the electricity
usage in year T–1, and the predictions for the control group in both year T and T + 1
are very close to the actual measured values. Both treatment groups have reduced
electricity usages during the peak-demand hours, and the active group reduced the
usage more than the passive group. This observation is in line with other studies.
Though the new data-driven baseline model LTAP predicts the average usages of
the control group accurately, there are some differences in predicted impact of the new
time-of-use pricing intended to reduce the usage during the peak-demand hours (see
Figure 22.6). For example, with the control group as the baseline, the active group
reduces its usage by 0.277 kWh (out of about 2 kWh) averaged over the peak-demand
hours in the first year with the new price and 0.198 kWh in the second year. Using
LTAP as the baseline, the average reductions are only 0.164 kWh for both years. Part
of the difference may be due to the self-selection bias in treatment groups, especially
the active group, where the households have to explicitly opt-in to participate in the
trial. It is likely that the households that elected to join the active group are well-suited
to take advantage of the proposed new pricing structure. We believe that the LTAP
baseline is a way to address the self-selection bias and plan to conduct additional
studies to further verify this.

dropped almost 10%, and many stocks traded at one cent per share, the minimum
price for any possible trade. Figure 22.7 shows an example of another extreme case,
where shares of Apple (symbol AAPL) traded at $100,000 per share, the maximum

possible price allowed by the exchange. Clearly, these were unusual events, which
undermined investors’ faith and confidence in our financial markets. Investors
demanded to know what caused these events.
To make our work relevant to the financial industry, we sought to experiment with
the HDF5 software, and apply it to the concrete task of computing earlier warn-
ing indicators. Based on recommendations from a group of institutional investors,
regulators, and academics, we implemented two sets of indicators that have been
shown to have “early warning” properties preceding the Flash Crash. They are the
Volume Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) (Easley, Lopez de
Prado, and O’Hara [2011]) and a variant of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
(Hirschman [1980]) of market fragmentation. We implemented these two algorithms
in the C++ language, while using MPI for inter-processor communication, to take
full advantage of the HPC systems. The reasoning behind this choice is that if any
of these earlier warning indicators is shown to be successful, the high-performance
implementation would allow us to extract the warning signals as early as possi-
ble so there might be time to take corrective actions. Our effort was one of the
first steps to demonstrate that it is possible to compute the earlier warning signals
fast enough.
For our work, we implemented two versions of the programs: one uses data orga-
nized in HDF5 files, and another reads the data from the commonly used ASCII text
files. Figure 22.8 shows the time required to process the trading records of all S&P
500 stocks over a 10-year timespan. Since the size of the 10-year trading data is
still relatively small, we replicated the data 10 times as well. On a single CPU core
(labeled “Serial” in Figure 22.8), it took about 3.5 hours with ASCII data, but only
603.98 seconds with HDF5 files. When 512 CPU cores are used, this time reduces to
2.58 seconds using HDF5 files, resulting in a speedup of 234 times.
On the larger (replicated) dataset, the advantage of HPC code for computing these
indices is even more pronounced. With 10 times as much data, it took only about 2.3

21 times longer when the same data is in ASCII files (603.98 seconds versus approximately 3.5 hours)
times longer for the computer to complete the tasks, a below-linear latency increase.
Using more CPU makes HPC even more scalable.
Figure 22.8 also shows that with a large data set, we can further take advantage of
the indexing techniques available in HDF5 to reduce the data access time (which in
turn reduces the overall computation time). When 512 CPU cores are used, the total
runtime is reduced from 16.95 seconds to 4.59 seconds, a speedup of 3.7 due to this
HPC technique of indexing.
22.6.5
Volume-synchronized Probability of Informed Trading Calibration
Understanding the volatility of the financial market requires the processing of a vast
amount of data. We apply techniques from data-intensive scientific applications for
this task, and demonstrate their effectiveness by computing an early warning indicator
called Volume Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) on a massive
set of futures contracts. The test data contains 67 months of trades for the hundred
most frequently traded futures contracts. On average, processing one contract over 67
months takes around 1.5 seconds. Before we had this HPC implementation, it took
about 18 minutes to complete the same task. Our HPC implementation achieves a
speedup of 720 times.
Note that the above speedup was obtained solely based on the algorithmic
improvement, without the benefit of parallelization. The HPC code can run on parallel
machines using MPI, and thus is able to further reduce the computation time.
The software techniques employed in our work include the faster I/O access
through HDF5 described above, as well as a more streamlined data structure for stor-
ing the bars and buckets used for the computation of VPIN. More detailed information
is available in Wu et al. [2013].

FIGURE 22.9
The average false positive rates (𝛼) of different classes of futures contracts ordered
according to their average.
With a faster program to compute VPIN, we were also able to explore the para-
metric choices more closely. For example, we were able to identify the parameter
values that reduce VPIN’s false positive rate over one hundred contracts from 20%
to only 7%, see Figure 22.9. The parameter choices to achieve this performance are:
(1) pricing the volume bar with the median prices of the trades (not the closing price
typically used in analyses), (2) 200 buckets per day, (3) 30 bars per bucket, (4) sup-
port window for computing VPIN = 1 day, event duration = 0.1 day, (5) bulk volume
classification with Student t-distribution with 𝜈= 0.1, and (6) threshold for CDF of
VPIN = 0.99. Again, these parameters provide a low false positive rate on the totality
of futures contracts, and are not the result of individual fitting.
On different classes of futures contracts, it is possible to choose different parame-
ters to achieve even lower false positive rates. In some cases, the false positive rates
can fall significantly below 1%. Based on Figure 22.9, interest rate and index futures
contracts typically have lower false positive rates. The futures contracts on commodi-
ties, such as energy and metal, generally have higher false positive rates.
Additionally, a faster program for computing VPIN allows us to validate that the
events identified by VPIN are “intrinsic,” in the sense that varying parameters such
as the threshold on VPIN CDF only slightly change the number of events detected.
Had the events been random, changing this threshold from 0.9 to 0.99 would have
reduced the number of events by a factor of 10. In short, a faster VPIN program also
allows us to confirm the real-time effectiveness of VPIN.

Revealing High Frequency Events with Non-uniform Fast
Fourier Transform
High Frequency Trading is pervasive across all electronic financial markets. As algo-
rithms replace tasks previously performed by humans, cascading effects similar to
the 2010 Flash Crash may become more likely. In our work (Song et al. [2014]), we

brought together a number of high performance signal-processing tools to improve
our understanding of these trading activities. As an illustration, we summarize the
Fourier analysis of the trading prices of natural gas futures.
Normally, Fourier analysis is applied on uniformly spaced data. Since market
activity comes in bursts, we may want to sample financial time series according to an
index of trading activity. For example, VPIN samples financial series as a function of
volume traded. However, a Fourier analysis of financial series in chronological time
may still be instructive. To this purpose, we use a non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) procedure.
From the Fourier analysis of the natural gas futures market, we see strong evi-
dences of High Frequency Trading in the market. The Fourier components corre-
sponding to high frequencies are (1) becoming more prominent in the recent years
and (2) are much stronger than could be expected from the structure of the market.
Additionally, a significant amount of trading activity occurs in the first second of
every minute, which is a tell-tale sign of trading triggered by algorithms that target a
Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP).
Fourier analysis on trading data shows that activities at the once-per-minute fre-
quency are considerably higher than at neighboring frequencies (see Figure 22.10).
Note that the vertical axis is in logarithmic scale. The strength of activities at once-
per-minute frequency is more than ten times stronger than the neighboring frequen-
cies. Additionally, the activity is very precisely defined at once-per-minute, which
indicates that these trades are triggered by intentionally constructed automated events.
We take this to be strong evidence that TWAP algorithms have a significant presence
in this market.
We expected the frequency analysis to show strong daily cycles. In Figure 22.10,
we expect amplitude for frequency 365 to be large. However, we see the highest
FIGURE 22.10
Fourier spectrum of trading prices of natural gas futures contracts in 2012. Non-uniform
FFT identifies strong presence of activities happening once per day (frequency = 366), twice per day
(frequency = 732), and once per minute (frequency = 527040 = 366*24*60).

amplitude was for the frequency of 366. This can be explained because 2012 was
a leap year. This is a validation that the non-uniform FFT is capturing the expected
signals. The second- and third-highest amplitudes have the frequencies of 732 and
52, which are twice-a-day and once-a-week. These are also unsurprising.
We additionally applied the non-uniform FFT on the trading volumes and found
further evidence of algorithmic trading. Moreover, the signals pointed to a stronger
presence of algorithmic trading in recent years. Clearly, the non-uniform FFT algo-
rithm is useful for analyzing highly irregular time series.

SUMMARY AND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
Currently, there are two primary ways to construct large-scale computing platforms:
the HPC approach and the cloud approach. Most of the scientific computing efforts
use the HPC approach, while most of the business computing needs are satisfied
through the cloud approach. The conventional wisdom is that the HPC approach occu-
pies a small niche of little consequence. This is not true. HPC systems are essential to
the progress of scientific research. They played important roles in exciting new sci-
entific discoveries including the Higgs particle and gravitational waves. They have
spurred the development of new subjects of study, such as behavioral economics, and
new ways of conducting commerce through the Internet. The usefulness of extremely
large HPC systems has led to the 2015 National Strategic Computing Initiative.3
There are efforts to make HPC tools even more useful by accelerating their adop-
tion in business applications. The HPC4Manufacturing4 effort is pioneering this
knowledge transfer to the U.S. manufacturing industry, and has attracted consider-
able attention. Now is the time to make a more concerted push for HPC to meet other
critical business needs.
In recent years, we have developed CIFT as a broad class of business applications
that could benefit from the HPC tools and techniques. In decisions such as how to
respond to a voltage fluctuation in a power transformer and an early warning signal
of impending market volatility event, HPC software tools could help determine the
signals early enough for decision makers, provide sufficient confidence about the pre-
diction, and anticipate the consequence before the catastrophic event arrives. These
applications have complex computational requirements and often have a stringent
demand on response time as well. HPC tools are better suited to meet these require-
ments than cloud-based tools.
In our work, we have demonstrated that the HPC I/O library HDF5 can be used to
accelerate the data access speed by 21-fold, and HPC techniques can accelerate the
computation of the Flash Crash early-warning indicator VPIN by 720-fold. We have
developed additional algorithms that enable us to predict the daily peak electricity

usage years into the future. We anticipate that applying HPC tools and techniques to
other applications could achieve similarly significant results.
In addition to the performance advantages mentioned above, a number of pub-
lished studies (Yelick et al. [2011], Holzman et al. [2017]) show HPC systems to
have a significant price advantage as well. Depending on the workload’s requirement
on CPU, storage, and networking, using a cloud system might cost 50% more than
using a HPC system, and, in some cases, as much as seven times more. For the com-
plex analytical tasks described in this book, with their constant need to ingest data
for analysis, we anticipate the cost advantage will continue to be large.
CIFT is expanding the effort to transfer HPC technology to private companies,
so that they can also benefit from the price and performance advantages enjoyed by
large-scale research facilities. Our earlier collaborators have provided the funds to
start a dedicated HPC system for our work. This resource should make it considerably
easier for interested parties to try out their applications on an HPC system. We are
open to different forms of collaborations. For further information regarding CIFT,
please visit CIFT’s web page at http://crd.lbl.gov/cift/.
